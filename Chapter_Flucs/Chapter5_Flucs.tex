\chapter{Fluctuations in the S1 and S2 Signals}
\label{Ch:Flucs}

In this chapter we discuss extracting recombination fluctuations from line sources and continuous spectra such as tritium. The method outlined here will be used to measure recombination fluctuations from the tritium calibration data down to 1 keV. We begin by modeling the intrinsic resolution of the LUX detector, based on counting statistics. We then separate the fluctuations in light and charge collection from recombination fluctuations using line source calibrations. Once the variances from light and charge collection are modeled, the recombination fluctuations from continuous spectra can be extracted, specifically for the tritium beta spectrum. We conclude with the results for recombination and recombination fluctuations as measured from tritium beta decay in the LUX detector along with a measure of the exciton-to-ion ratio $\rm \alpha$ for ER events. Since we use photons and electrons (S1 and S2) to discriminate background events in LUX, understanding recombination fluctuations are of great importance.

\section{An Introduction to Fluctuations}

When Xenon TPCs were first developed it was expected that the resolution in the ionization and scintillation channels would be dominated by detector resolution. The only fluctuations fundamental to liquid xenon is theorized to be from the Fano factor along with an additional binomial variance in electron ion pair recombination. Recombination models from \cite{Thomas_Imel} and \cite{Birks}, used in \cite{NEST_2013}, assume that the total observed recombination is the result each electron-ion pairs interacting with itself, known as geminate recombination. The variance for such a process with recombination probability $\rm r_p$ acting on $\rm n_i$ number of ions is $\rm (1-r_p)r_pn_i$. Thus, a liquid xenon detector with infinite resolution should observe fluctuations governed by, 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \sigma_{n_\gamma}^2=r_p^2Fn_i + (1-r_p)r_p n_i \\
\rm \sigma_{n_e}^2=(1-r_p)^2Fn_i + (1-r_p)r_p n_i
\label{eq:Fano_Intro}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where F is the Fano factor, F= 0.05 in liquid xenon \cite{FanoTheoretical}, and $\rm r_p$ is the recombination probability. Note, equation \ref{eq:Fano_Intro} will be derived later in this chapter (given in equations \ref{eq:SigR_g} and \ref{eq:SigR_e}). The recombination probability $\rm r_p$ is equal to the average observed recombination $\rm \left<r\right>$ as the number of events becomes large, given in table \ref{table:Fluc_Param}.

The variance in equation \ref{eq:Fano_Intro} is, in fact, orders of magnitude smaller than the observed variance. This has been an unsolved mystery since the first xenon TPCs was built. Fortunately, these large fluctuations in scintillation and ionization are 100\% anti-correlated and cancel when both light and charge is combined to measure energy. We refer to these fluctuations as recombination fluctuations $\rm \sigma_R$. The 100\% anti-correlation implies that for each additional electron-ion recombination a single photon is produced at the cost of a single electron, and visa versa.

Let us consider the 164 keV line from $\rm ^{131}Xe$ used to produce the Doke plots in chapter \ref{Ch:E_Scale_Cal}. An illustration with all the fluctuations in units of quanta is shown in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Ex}, with the number of photons (S1/$\rm g_1$) plotted vs the number of electrons (S2/$\rm g_2$). The values of $\rm g_1$ and $\rm g_2$ were determined from calibrations in chapter \ref{Ch:E_Scale_Cal}.

\noindent The blue and magenta arrows labeled as $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}$ are the size of fluctuations in the light and charge measurement due to the resolution of the LUX detector. The value of $\rm \left<r\right>$ is the average observed recombination fraction and can be thought of as the average recombination probability $\rm r_p$. The red lines represent constant $\rm \left<r\right> \pm \sigma_r $ assuming the expected binomial variance of equation \ref{eq:Fano_Intro}. The expected recombination (in red) is small compared to fluctuations from detector resolutions and is more than a factor of ten less than that observed. The black lines represent constant $\rm \left<r\right> \pm \sigma_r $ measured from the data. The size of recombination fluctuations $\rm \sigma_R$ are dominant over detector resolution stretching the island size along lines of constant energy (black dashed line). The island is not stretched exactly along the black dashed line as the non negligible component from detector resolution also warp the population. The projection of the population onto the combined quanta axis $\rm (n_\gamma + n_e)$, or energy E/W, is shown in figure\ref{fig:Flucs_Ex_E}.

\noindent In the combined light and charge axis we find that the recombination fluctuations have vanished, leaving only the statistical variance from detector resolution. Some useful definitions of parameters which will be discussed in this section are given in table \ref{table:Fluc_Param}.

\section{Modeling Intrinsic Detector Resolution}

Intrinsic statistical fluctuations in light and charge (S1 and S2) collection in the LUX detector lead to a spread in collected quanta. To measure effects from recombination fluctuations and the Fano factor, we must first decouple the detector component of resolution. We use the model described in \cite{Platzman} \cite{Dahl_Thesis} in which the measured scintillation and ionization signals (S1 and S2 measured in PE) are related to the number of photons and electrons by gains $\rm g_1$ and $\rm g_2$, equation \ref{eq:Gain1} and \ref{eq:Gain2}. Specifically, the average number of photons and electrons produced for a given energy deposit are proportional to the average S1 and S2 signals.

\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:Gain1} \rm  \left<n_\gamma\right> = \frac{\left<S1\right>}{g_1}\\
\label{eq:Gain2} \rm \left<n_{e}\right> = \frac{\left<S2\right>}{g_2}
\end{alignat}

\noindent where the gain $\rm g_1$ represents photon detection efficiency, the probability of a photon from an energy deposit striking a PMT and producing a photo electron signal (PE). Gain $\rm g_2$ represents the average S2 signal of a single electron multiplied by the electron extraction efficiency $\rm \epsilon$. Here, we are only using the S2 of the bottom PMT array and is corrected for electron-lifetime. The fluctuations in photons and electrons are related to the observables S1 and S2 by equations \ref{eq:Gain1} and \ref{eq:Gain2}

\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:Sig_g1} \rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_{S1_{stat}}^2}{g_1^2}\\
\label{eq:Sig_g2} \rm \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_{S2_{stat}}^2}{g_2^2}
\end{alignat}

\noindent where $\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}}^2$ represent the variance in the average number of measured photons and electrons as measured through S1 and S2, respectively. The variances in S1 and S2, $\rm \sigma_{S1_{stat}}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{S2_{stat}}^2$, are the observable quantities with the detector. The variance in terms of quanta ($\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$) must be considered in terms of the PE being counted by the PMTs. Note, here we are working with the x,y,z corrected signals outlined in chapter \ref{Ch:3}. 


Before proceeding to derive the statistical variance in light and charge, we overview a list of terms and their values in the LUX detector, given in table \ref{table:LUX_Det_Param}.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

 \\ \hline
$\rm g_1$	& photon detection probability	& 0.097 $\pm$ 0.008 $\rm[PE/n_\gamma]$ \\ \hline

$\rm \epsilon$ & electron extraction probability & 0.593 $\pm$ 0.144 \\ \hline
$\rm \sigma_{SE_b}$ & single electron resolution, bottom PMT array & 3.6 $\rm [PE/n_e]$ \\ \hline
$\rm \kappa$	& fraction of non-attenuated electrons & 0.85 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{LUX detector parameters, used to measure statistical fluctuations in the light (S1) and charge (S2) channels. Where the S1 and S2 signals have been corrected for position dependence outlined in section \ref{Ch:3}. The values of $\rm g_1$ and $\rm g_2$ where measured in section \ref{Ch:E_Scale_Cal}. }
\label{table:LUX_Det_Param}
\end{center}
\end{table}


The statistical variance of the x,y,z corrected S1 signal, in equation \ref{eq:Sig_g1}, can be broken into two linearly independent parts. First we consider the binomial variance. For each event there are $\rm n_\gamma$ number of PE to be collected by the PMTs with probability $\rm g_1$. Here, $\rm n_\gamma$ should be thought of as the number of trials. The binomial variance is,
\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{S1_{Bino}}^2 = (1-g_1) g_1 n_\gamma
\label{eq:S1_bino} 
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\rm \sigma_{S1_{Bino}}^2$ is the binomial variance of the S1 light collection process with probability $\rm g_1$ and $\rm n_\gamma$ number of trials. Each PE that was collected by a PMT then undergoes a second fluctuation due to the resolution of the PMTs. The variance from PMT resolution can be written as
\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{S1_{PMT}}^2 = g_1 n_\gamma \sigma_{PE}^2
\label{eq:S1_pmt}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\rm \sigma_{S1_{PMT}}^2$ is the average variance due to PMT resolution. The average single PE resolution of the PMTs is $\rm \sigma_{PE}^2$ and is multiplied by the number of PE collected, $\rm g_1n_\gamma$. 


Combining the two linearly independent processes of equation \ref{eq:S1_bino} and \ref{eq:S1_pmt} leads to the result in equation \ref{eq:Sig_S1}.
\begin{equation}
\rm  \sigma_{S1_{stat}}^2 = (1-g_1+\sigma_{PE}^2) (g_1 n_\gamma) = (1-g_1+\sigma_{PE}^2) S1 \\ 
\label{eq:Sig_S1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm \sigma_{S1_{stat}}^2 $ is the statistical variance of the S1 signal. The variance in the measured number of photons is then equation \ref{eq:Sig_S1} divided by $\rm g_1^2$, using equation \ref{eq:Sig_g1$}.
\begin{equation}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}^2 = \frac{(1-g_1+\sigma_{PE}^2)}{g_1} n_\gamma \\ 
\label{eq:Sig_Ng}
\end{equation}

We test equation \ref{eq:Sig_S1} and \ref{eq:Sig_Ng} by using the 9.4 $\rm keV$ S1 signal from \KrCal. At that energy the dominant fluctuation is due the statistical variance of light collection, we can ignore contributions from recombination fluctuations and instrumental fluctuations (will be discussed later in this section). The S1 signal is shown in figure \ref{fig:S1_9_Kr}.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
\includegraphics[width=100mm]{Chapter_Flucs//Figures/S1_9_Fluc/S1_9_corr_1000_lux10_20130510T1250_cp09323.eps}
\caption{The fluctuations in the S1-x,y,z corrected signal for the 9.4 keV from \KrCal. At 9.4 keV the statistical variance is dominant over recombination fluctuations, $\rm \sigma_{S1}=8.15$. The resolution is consistent with that expected from statistical fluctuations of 8.3 $\pm$ 0.1 PE, from equation \ref{eq:Sig_S1}. }
\label{fig:S1_9_Kr}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\noindent We find that the observed $\rm \sigma_{S1}$ = 8.15 PE is in good agreement with the expectation from equation \ref{eq:Sig_S1} of 8.3 $\pm$ 0.1 PE. In terms of photons, $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}$ = 84.1 with the expectation from equation \ref{eq:Sig_Ng} of 85.7 $\pm$ 1, (having used the values listed in table \ref{table:LUX_Det_Param}).


The variance of the x,y,z corrected S2 signal, given in \ref{eq:Sig_g2$},  is also comprised of several independent processes. Each electron that reaches the liquid-gas interface without being attenuated will either be extracted into the gas producing $\rm SE_b$ number of PE or not. The binomial variance of such a process is,

\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{S2_{bino}}^2= (1-\epsilon) \epsilon (\kappa n_e) SE_{b}^2 
\label{eq:Sig_S2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm \epsilon$ is the electron extraction probability, and $\rm \kappa n_e$ is the average number of electrons that reach the liquid surface from the interaction site, also the number of trials. Recalling that $\kappa$ is the average electron probability of an electron to not be captured by an electronegative impurity. For the case of LUX with an electron lifetime of $\sim 1000 \, \mu s$ and an average drift time of 160 $\rm  \mu s$ the value of $\rm \kappa$ = 0.85 and is listed in table \ref{table:LUX_Det_Param}. Each electron that gets extracted then multiplies producing $\rm SE_b$ PE in the bottom PMT array, this multiplicative factor must be squared in the variance. 

Next, we consider the spread of the single electron size as measured by the bottom PMT array, $\rm \sigma_{SE_{b}}$. The variance from the PMT resolution for the $\rm \epsilon (\kappa n_e)$ number of electrons extracted is,
\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{S2_{PMT}}^2 = \epsilon (\kappa n_e)  \sigma_{SE}^2
\label{eq:S2_PMT}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm \epsilon \kappa n_e$ is the number of extracted electrons each with PMT resolution $\rm \sigma_{SE}^2$.

For the S2 signal we must also consider the additional variance from electron attenuation as the electrons drift. We model the process with a Poisson probability of electron capture in each Z slice of the detector. The variance from each Z slice depends of the average number of electrons that will be attenuated. The probability of attenuation at each slice in drift-time T is $\rm P(T)= 1-e^{-T/\tau}$, where $\rm \tau$ for the data sets to be considered is 1000 $\rm \mu s$. The drift region considered in the fiducial volume is from 38 to 304.5 $\rm \mu s$. The average variance from events in the fiducial can be given by equation \ref{eq:Sig_Att}.

\begin{equation}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{e_{att}}}^2 = n_e \frac{\mathlarger{\int}\limits_{\mathsmaller{T_{min}}}^{\mathsmaller{T_{max}}} (1-e^{-T/\tau})\mathrm{d}T}{\mathlarger{\int}\limits_{\mathsmaller{T_{min}}}^{\mathsmaller{T_{max}}}\mathrm{d}T} = 0.155 \times n_e
\label{eq:Sig_Att}
\end{equation}

Combining the variances from equations \ref{eq:Sig_S2} \ref{eq:S2_PMT} and \ref{eq:Sig_Att} leads to the the result for the statistical variance in the observed S2 signal,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \sigma_{S2_{stat}}^2 = (1-\epsilon)\epsilon  (\kappa n_e) SE_b^2 + \epsilon  (\kappa n_e) \sigma_{SE}^2+  g_2^2 \sigma_{n_{e_{att}}}^2 \\
\rm  \sigma_{S2_{stat}}^2= \left((1-\epsilon) SE_b \kappa + \sigma_{SE}^2 \kappa/g_2+  0.155 g_2\right)S2\\
\label{eq:Sig_S2_2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}}^2 = \frac{(1-\epsilon)\epsilon SE_b^2 + \epsilon  \sigma_{SE}^2}{g_2^2} \kappa n_e+  \sigma_{n_{e_{att}}}^2 \\
\label{eq:Sig_Ne}
\end{equation}


%For this analysis we use the following detector gains: \ref{eq:$\rm g_1$$\rm g_2$}. 
%\begin{multline} \\
%\rm g_1 = 0.097 \pm 0.008 \,[PE/n_\gamma]\\
%\rm g_2=SE_{b} \times \epsilon = 5.75 \pm 1.4 \,[PE/n_e]\\
%\rm SE_{b} = 9.70 \pm 0.05  \,[PE/n_e] \\\ 
%\rm \sigma_{SE_b} = 3.64\, [PE/n_e]\\
%\rm \Gamma = \left<n_{e_z0}\right>/\left<n_e\right>=0.85 \\
%\rm \epsilon = 0.593\pm 0.144 \\
%\rm \sigma_{PE} = 0.51\, [PE/n_\gamma]\\\
%\label{eq:$\rm g_1$$\rm g_2$}
%\end{multline}

Using equations \ref{eq:Sig_Ng}, \ref{eq:Sig_Ne} and table \ref{table:LUX_Det_Param} we calculate the intrinsic detector resolution for S1 and S2 signals in the LUX detector, given equation \ref{eq:SigStat}. Note, the intrinsic resolution in S2 is sub-dominant to that of S1, since  on average one extracted electron multiplies to about ten PE detected by the bottom PMT array, while one photon leads to 0.097 PE. Also listed in \ref{eq:SigInst}, are the instrumental fluctuations with a linear dependence on quanta measured using calibrations discussed in section \ref{sec:flucs_mono}. The total variance that the detector observes in the light and charge is the linear combination of the statistical and instrumental variance given in equation \ref{eq:SigDet}.  

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}} = 3.45\pm_{0.15}^{0.17} \sqrt{n_\gamma}\\
\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}} = 1.04\pm_{0.20}^{0.26} \sqrt{n_e}
\label{eq:SigStat}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where  $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}}$ are the statistical fluctuations outlined in this section.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{inst}}} = \frac{6.4\pm 1.7}{100} \times n_\gamma\\
\rm  \sigma_{n_{e_{inst}}} = \frac{6.6\pm 0.9}{100} \times n_e
\label{eq:SigInst}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where  $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{inst}}}$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{inst}}}$ are instrumental fluctuations extracted in section \ref{sec:flucs_mono} that grow like number of quanta n but only appear to turn on above 200 keV.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}^2 + \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{inst}}}^2 \\
\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}}^2 + \sigma_{n_{e_{inst}}}^2
\label{eq:SigDet}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where  $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2$ are the fluctuations in counting photons and electrons, respectively, due to detector resolution.


\section{Measuring Recombination Fluctuations with Mono-Energetic Sources}
\label{sec:flucs_mono}

To model recombination we start with the assumption that for a given energy deposit in liquid xenon the number of quanta produced is equal to the number of excitons and the number of ions \cite{Platzman}. 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \frac{E}{W} = n_q = n_i + n_{ex} = n_i(1+\alpha) \\
\rm \frac{E}{W} = n_\gamma + n_e = \frac{S1}{g_1} + \frac{S2}{g_2} \\
\label{eq:Energy}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where E is energy in keV, W is the work function in keV/quanta, $\rm n_{q}$ is the number of quanta, $\rm n_{i}$ is the number of ions, $\rm n_{ex}$ is the number of excitons and and $\rm \alpha$ is the exciton-to-ion ratio. The measured value of the number of excitons produced to ions is $\rm \frac{n_{ex}}{n_{i}}= \alpha = 0.20$ \cite{Doke_alpha} and is not expected to change as a function of energy \cite{alpha_argon} \cite{alpha_xenon} \cite{Dahl_Thesis}. For the subsequent equations in this section we will simplify equations \ref{eq:Energy}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \alpha = 0.20\\
\rm  n_i = \frac{E}{W} \frac{1}{(1+\alpha)} =  \frac{n_\gamma + n_e}{(1+\alpha)}  \\ %  \frac{n_q}{(1+\alpha)}
\label{eq:Energy_2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent Equation \ref{eq:Energy_2} gives us a simple model for the number of ions produced for a given interaction. We work in number of ions for convenience as the recombination fluctuations act only on ions. The only variation in quanta thus far is due to a Fano factor governing the variation in initial quanta produced. 
\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{n_i}^2  = F \times n_i
\label{eq:Fano_1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where F is the Fano factor. The value of F for liquid xenon is small and has a theoretical value of 0.05 \cite{FanoTheoretical}.


We now describe the observed scintillation and ionization signals that are measured in the LUX detector as a function of $\rm n_i$. The number of photons observed for a given energy deposit arise from the excitons that de-excite and from ions which recombine with freed electrons.
\begin{equation}
\rm  n_\gamma = n_{ex} + n_i\times r = n_i\times (r+\alpha) \\
\label{eq:Photons}
\end{equation}

\noindent The number of electrons corresponding to a given energy deposit is equal to the number of ions that did not recombine with a free electron. 

\begin{equation}
\rm  n_e = n_i\times (1-r)\\
\label{eq:Electrons}
\end{equation}

\noindent The recombination fraction of each event can be solved for in terms of number of photons and electrons produced,

\begin{equation}
\rm r= \frac{\frac{n_\gamma}{n_e}-\alpha}{\frac{n_\gamma}{n_e} + 1}
\label{eq:recomb_frac}
\end{equation}

\noindent where r represents the electron-ion recombination probability of each event. 

Two key measurable quantities from the scintillation and ionization signals are the average recombination fraction $\rm \left<r\right>$ and the spread in recombination probability $\rm \sigma_{\left<r\right>}$. The average recombination fraction $\rm \left<r\right>$ can be interpreted as the electron-ion pair recombination probability $\rm r_p$. The recombination fluctuation in units of quanta is 
\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_R = \rm \sigma_{\left<r\right>} \times n_i
\label{eq:R_eq}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\rm \sigma_R$ is the recombination fluctuation. As mentioned earlier, the recombination fluctuations in the data are much larger than those expected from the binomial variance of a binomial process with probability $\rm r_p$ or from the Fano factor, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Ex}.


 We now combine the variance from the Fano factor, recombination and detector resolution (equation \ref{eq:SigDet}) and solve for the total observed variance in photons and electrons given in \ref{eq:SigR_g} and \ref{eq:SigR_e}

\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:SigR_g} \rm \sigma_{n_\gamma}^2  =\sigma_{n_{ex}}^2 + \sigma_{n_i}^2 r_p^2 +  \sigma_{\left<r\right>}^2 n_i^2 +\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 =  [\sigma_{n_{ex}}^2 + n_iF r_p^2] + \sigma_{\left<r\right>}^2 n_i^2 + \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 \\
\label{eq:SigR_e} \rm \sigma_{n_e}^2  = \sigma_{n_i}^2 (1-r_p)^2 +  \sigma_{\left<r\right>}^2 n_i^2 +\sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2= [n_iF(1-r)^2]+ \sigma_{\left<r\right>}^2 n_i^2 +\sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2
\end{alignat}

\noindent where $\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2$ is the variance in exciton production, F is the Fano factor, the term $\rm \sigma_{\left<r\right>}^2 n_i^2$ is the recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma_R$. The remaining variables are described in table \ref{table:Fluc_Param}. 

Using a line source, we measure combined energy (equation \ref{eq:Energy}) and $\rm \sigma_{n_\gamma}^2$, $\rm \sigma_{n_e}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{E}^2$. Dropping the contribution form the Fano factor and the the number of excitons in equations \ref{eq:SigR_g} and \ref{eq:SigR_e} the variance of $\rm \sigma_{n_\gamma}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_e}^2$ is a linear combination of detector resolution and recombination fluctuations.

\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:SigQ_g} \rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 + \sigma_R^2\\
\label{eq:SigQ_e} \rm \sigma_{n_{e}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 + \sigma_R^2
\end{alignat}

\noindent this concept is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Ex}. The value of recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma_R$ can be determined by rearranging equations \ref{eq:SigQ_g} and \ref{eq:SigQ_e}. As shown in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Ex_E}, when the light and charge signals are combined the resulting variance $\rm \sigma_{E}^2$ contains no recombination fluctuations, as recombination fluctuations are 100\% anti-correlated in light and charge. 
\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{R}^2  = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma_{n_\gamma}^2 + \sigma_{n_e}^2 - \frac{\sigma_E^2}{W^2}\right)\\
\label{eq:Dahl}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the variance in photons $\rm \sigma_{n_\gamma}^2$, electrons $\rm  \sigma_{n_e}^2$  and quanta $\rm \frac{\sigma_E^2}{W^2}$ are all observable quantities with a line source. The recombination variance can be written in terms of the observable quantities S1 and S2.

\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{R}^2  = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\sigma_{S1}^2}{g_1^2} + \frac{\sigma_{S2}^2}{g_2^2} - \frac{\sigma_E^2}{W^2}\right)\\
\label{eq:Dahl_2}
\end{equation}

\noindent We now have a method to extract the recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma_R$ using a line calibration source. To complete our treatment of line sources, the variance in the light and charge due to detector resolution can also be measured.

\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:SigQ_S1} \rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_{S1}^2}{g_1^2} - \sigma_R^2\\
\label{eq:SigQ_S2} \rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_{S2}^2}{g_2^2} - \sigma_R^2
\end{alignat}


Using equation \ref{eq:Dahl_2}, \ref{eq:SigQ_S1} and \ref{eq:SigQ_S2} along with the measurements of $\rm g_1$ $\rm g_2$, we construct a combined energy and deconvolve the recombination fluctuations from variances in the light and charge observed by the detector. The result is shown in figure \ref{fig:E_dis}, The black white and red lines represent $\rm \sigma_R, \, \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}, \,\sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}$, respectively.

A variance with a linear and root term is fit to the data with the results given in \ref{eq:Inst_Fit}. The linear term corresponds to instrumental fluctuations and the root term corresponds to statistical fluctuations. Instrumental fluctuations are proportional to the signal size and cause the fluctuations in $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}, \,\sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}} $ at high energies to deviate from statistical fluctuations alone. 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Stat}}}^2 + \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Inst}}}^2 =\left(0 \pm10\cdot \sqrt{n_\gamma}\right)^2 + \left((6.4\pm1.8)/100\cdot n_\gamma\right)^2 \\
\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{e_{Stat}}}^2 + \sigma_{n_{e_{Inst}}}^2 = \left(1\pm4\cdot \sqrt{n_e}\right)^2 + \left((6.6\pm0.6)/100\cdot n_e\right)^2 \\
\rm \sigma_R^2=   \left((5.5\pm0.5)/100\cdot n_q\right)^2
\label{eq:Inst_Fit}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent With the limited data we can not tightly constrain the root-n term. The statistical fluctuation expected from equation \ref{eq:SigStat} is consistent with the observed values without the instrumental component for calibration energies at and below 236.8 keV. The instrumental fluctuations appear to turn on above $\sim$200 keV and may be due to ripples in the liquid surface caused by xenon bubbles or other systematics. 


\section{Measuring Recombination Fluctuations in Discrete Energy Bins}
\label{sec:flucs_mono_bins}

The previous section outlined a method to extract recombination fluctuations from line source calibrations, equation \ref{eq:Dahl_2}. In this section the formalism to measure recombination fluctuations when considering events binned in energy will be outlined. The consideration of discrete binning is crucial when dealing with a continual energy spectrum. Take the tritium beta spectrum as an example. We lose the ability to independently measure $\rm \sigma_{n_\gamma}^2$, $\rm \sigma_{n_e}^2$, $\rm \sigma_{E}^2 $ and are only left with a smear of $\rm n_\gamma$, $\rm n_e$, $\rm E $. However, there are two key pieces of information still left at our disposal. %First, the combined energy can be reconstructed from constraints on $\rm g_1$ and $\rm g_2$, and even corrected for spectral shape and detector resolution (discussed later in section \ref{sec:Smear}). Second, know the dependence of detector resolution as a function of quanta, given in \ref{eq:SigStat} and  \ref{eq:SigInst}. 
Knowing $\rm g_1$, $\rm g_2$ and the intrinsic detector resolution is sufficient to measure recombination fluctuations for a continual energy spectrum. 
%binned in energy with width $\rm \Delta_E$.

To simplify the picture we introduce new variables when dealing with events having been cut in energy of bin of width $\rm \Delta_E$.  After cutting in energy, we define the remaining variance projected onto light and charge as $\chi_{n_{\gamma}}^2$ and $\chi_{n_{e}}^2$, which is analogous to $\sigma_{n_{\gamma}}^2$ and $\sigma_{n_{e}}^2$ of equations \ref{eq:SigQ_g} \ref{eq:SigQ_e}, respectively. We denote the component of variance from detector resolution contained in the slice of energy as $\rm \chi_{Det}$. These concepts will be clarified in the subsequent examples and are summarized in table \ref{table:E_Slice}.

 \newpage

We will overview the treatment of binning by considering two cases using a simulated \KrCal line-source. For each case, the energy is defined using equation \ref {eq:Energy} and a cut is energy of width $\rm \Delta_E=1 keV$ is made about the energy center. First, variance from detector resolution is turned off leaving only recombination fluctuations. The value of recombination fluctuations in terms of quanta is set to $\rm \sigma_R = 90 $ in the simulation, similar to the value extracted from the \KrCal data in table \ref{table:Line_Data}. Figure \ref{fig:Kr_ex_R} shows the result of such a system.

The recombination fluctuation move along the line of constant energy about the center, shown in black with bin width of $\rm \Delta_E$ =1 keV. The events between the black lines and projected onto the $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ axes. The variance in $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ are $\sigma_{n_{\gamma}}^2 = \rm \chi_{n_{\gamma}}^2 = \sigma_{R}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e}}^2 = \rm \chi_{n_{e}}^2 = \sigma_{R}^2$.  }
\label{fig:Kr_ex_R}
\end{figure}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{2}
\small\normalsize

\newpage

\noindent In figure \ref{fig:Kr_ex_R} we see that recombination fluctuations move events along the diagonal of constant energy, as expected. The standard deviation in light and charge is found by the fit to be 90.3$\pm$0.3, consistent to what was input into the simulation, 90. For the case of only recombination fluctuations and perfect detector resolution we find, 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma}}^2 = \chi_{n_{\gamma}}^2  = \sigma_{R}^2 \\
\rm  \sigma_{n_{e}}^2 = \chi_{n_{e}}^2 = \sigma_{R}^2
\end{split}
\label{eq:Ex_R_only}
\end{equation}

\noindent The key point demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:Kr_ex_R} is that all contribution from recombination fluctuations are included when slicing along a contour of energy about the center, no matter how thin we make the cut. Note, with infinite detector resolution the population becomes a delta function in energy about the central value.

Next, we visualize how the intrinsic detector resolution, $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 \,and\, \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 $, appears along a contour of constant energy for a simulated \KrCal source. The recombination fluctuations are set to zero and the fluctuations from detector resolution are set to $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}$ = 171 and $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}$ = 51, close to the true values of the LUX detector in table \ref{table:Line_Data}. The slice in combined energy is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:Kr_ex_R}, using a bin width of $\rm \Delta_E = 1$ keV (73 quanta).

The events that fall between the black dashed lines are projected onto the $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ axes. The square root of the observed variance in light and charge are show on the labels with and without the energy cut, as $\rm \chi$ and $\rm \sigma$ respectively. The energy cut has swept out a component of variance $\rm \chi_{Det}$ that is shared between the light and charge channels. }

\end{figure}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{2}
\small\normalsize

\newpage

\noindent In the example pictured in figure \ref {fig:Kr_ex_Stat} we find that the energy cut leaves a reduced statistical component to be projected onto $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$. The reduction in variance projected onto $\rm n_\gamma$ is an order of magnitude. However, this is expected as only a small portion of $\rm n_\gamma$ is included with the energy cut shown in figure \ref {fig:Kr_ex_Stat}. 

With the examples shown in figure \ref{fig:Kr_ex_R} and \ref{fig:Kr_ex_Stat} we can now visualize the effect of an energy cut on fluctuations in the light ($\rm n_\gamma$) and charge signals ($\rm n_e$). The slice, by definition, contains only events which fluctuated about the contour of constant energy thus, automatically including all recombination fluctuations and only a reduced component from detector resolution ($\rm \chi_{Det}$).

To solve for the value of  $\rm \chi_{Det}$ we write the detector-resolution fluctuations $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}$ as a function of combined energy in number quanta.

\begin{equation}
\rm n_q= E/W = n_\gamma + n_e
\label{eq:n_Q}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm n_q$ is the number of quanta (photons + electrons), E is energy in keV, and W=13.7$\pm$0.001 keV/quanta. Next, consider the the slope induced by the statistical variance of $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}$ as a function quanta $\rm n_q$. The slope between $\rm n_\gamma$ with respect to total quanta $\rm n_q$ (energy) is the variance in $\rm n_\gamma$ over the variance in $\rm n_q$, and the same for $\rm n_e$. The result for the slope M considering a detector with resolution $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}$ is,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm M = tan(\theta_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}})=\frac{\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2}{\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2+ \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2} \\
\rm 1-M = tan(\theta_{n_{e_{Det}}})=\frac{\sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2}{\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2+ \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2} 
\label{eq:Angle}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where M is the slope of $\rm n_\gamma$ with respect to $\rm n_q$. Once M is defined, the angle between $\rm n_e$ and $\rm n_q$ is the complementary slope (1-M).  The slope M can also be thought of as tan($\rm \theta$) where $\rm \theta$ is the angle between $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_q$, ranging from 0 to $\pi$/4. The slope of the population induced by the statistical variance of $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ with respect to the quanta (or E/W) axis can be expressed interns of the slope M.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm n_\gamma = M n_q \\
\rm n_e = (1-M) n_q \\
\label{eq:N_q_M}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent Using equation \ref{eq:N_q_M} and \ref{eq:n_Q} we solve for the for a small variation in $\rm n_q$ induced by the fluctuations in $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ along a contour of constant $\rm n_q$. First holding the number of photons $\rm n_\gamma$ constant and allowing for small variations in $\rm n_e$ and then holding the number of electrons $\rm n_e$ constant and allowing for small variations in $\rm n_\gamma$.

\begin{multline}\\
\delta n_q = \frac{\partial n_\gamma}{\partial n_q} \delta n_q \bigg|_{n_{\gamma}} + \frac{\partial n_e}{\partial n_q} \delta n_q \bigg|_{n_{e}} \\
\delta n_q = \frac{\partial (n_q-n_e)}{\partial n_q} \delta n_e + \frac{\partial (n_q-n_\gamma)}{\partial n_q} \delta n_\gamma \\
\delta n_q = \bigg[\cancelto{\tiny{1}}{\frac{\partial n_q}{\partial n_q}}-\cancelto{\tiny{(1-M)}}{\frac{\partial n_e}{\partial n_q}}\bigg] \delta n_e + \bigg[\cancelto{\tiny{1}}{\frac{\partial n_q}{\partial n_q}}-\cancelto{\tiny{M}}{\frac{\partial n_\gamma}{\partial n_q}}\bigg] \delta n_\gamma  \\
\delta n_q = (M) \delta n_e + (1-M) \delta n_\gamma \\
\label{eq:Chi_Det}
\end{multline}

\noindent squaring the result from equation \ref{eq:Chi_Det} the variance along an infinitely thin line of constant energy induced by statistical fluctuations is,

\begin{equation}
\rm \chi_{Det}^2= Var(\delta n_q) = M^2\sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 + (1-M)^2\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2
\label{eq:SigCE}
\end{equation}

\noindent where M is given in equation \ref{eq:Angle} and the cross term $\rm \delta n_\gamma \delta n_e$ has been dropped as the statistical variance from detector resolution ($\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2$) are uncorrelated. Combining equation \ref{eq:SigCE} and the equation for slope M in equation \ref{eq:Angle} simplifies the expression for $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ to,

\begin{equation}
\rm \chi_{Det}^2 =\frac{\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2\sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2}{\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2+ \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2} \\
\label{eq:SigCE_final}
\end{equation}

\noindent the expression for $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ describes the amount of statistical variance that will be included with the recombination fluctuations when events are cut along contours of constant energy. The only information needed to determine are $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ is $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{n_{Det}}}^2$, which are given in equation \ref{eq:SigDet} as a function of quanta. 

\label{sec:Chi_ex_1}
The example shown in figure \ref{fig:Kr_ex_Stat} can now be understood in terms of $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$. The simulation had used values of $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}$ = 171 and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}$ = 51. Solving for M using equation \ref{eq:Angle} we find, M = 0.92, meaning that the angle $\theta$ of the bulk population between the $\rm n_\gamma$ axis and the line of constant quanta (E/W) is 42.6$\degree$. Plugging the values into equation \ref{eq:SigCE_final}  the value of $\rm \chi_{Det}$=49 quanta. This is within 10\% of the value of $\chi_{n_\gamma}$ and $\chi_{n_e}$ observed in the simulated data set. Later we will expand upon equation \ref{eq:Chi_Det} to account for the finite bin width.

 
 %(Note, an identical result to \ref{eq:SigCE} is reached when discarding the slope and dealing in centroid subtracted units (Patrick's thesis)).

Let us briefly consider the implication of equation \ref{eq:SigCE} and \ref{eq:SigCE_final}. In the case of equal detector resolution in light and charge, $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2$, the value of M is 0.5 leading to, $\rm \chi_{Det}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 $. Curiously, regardless of the resolution in light and charge the statistical variance in a cut of  energy is always less than the variance of the best channel. Specifically for the LUX detector, the implication of equation \ref{eq:SigCE} is that the statistical variance measured in a a cut on energy will be less than that of the S2 statistical uncertainty. The illustration for the case of $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}= \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}$ = 100 is shown in figure \ref{fig:Kr_ex_Stat_circle}. As expected, the square root of the variance along the line of constant energy is about 100/$\rm \sqrt{2}$ = 70.7.

To complete the treatment of $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ we add the contribution to variance from the finite bin width $\rm \Delta_E$. The residual variance arises from projecting the rotated population onto $\rm n_\gamma$ or $\rm n_e$, the rotation having a slope of M and (1-M) respectively, given in equation \ref{eq:Angle}. Note, the residual variance from the rotation can also be removed by working with the centroid subtracted projections of number of photons and electrons as a function of energy, as discussed later in section \ref{sec:Centroid}. Considering the bin width, the total variance from detector resolution projected in $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ is 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2= \chi_{Det}^2 + \frac{(MW\Delta_E)^2}{12}\\
\rm \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2= \chi_{Det}^2 + \frac{((1-M)W\Delta_E)^2}{12}\\
\label{eq:SigCE_2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ is defined in \ref{eq:SigCE_final}, M is given in equation \ref{eq:Angle}, W is the work function in quanta/keV, $\rm \Delta_E$ is the bin width in energy keV, the normalization of 1/12 arises from rotating a uniform population about its center. The value of $\rm \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2$ is the variance from statistical fluctuations after cutting along a line of constant energy having width $\rm \Delta_E$ and then projecting onto the $\rm n_\gamma$ axis. Similarly, $\rm \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2$ is the variance from statistical fluctuations after cutting along a line of constant energy and projecting onto the $\rm n_e$ axis. 

The correction given in equation \ref{eq:SigCE_2} is applied to the example in figure \ref{fig:Kr_ex_Stat}, which used a bin width of 1 keV  (73 quanta). The value of $\rm \chi_{Det}$ was previously calculated to be 49 quanta. The additional contribution from bin width results in $\rm \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}$ = 52.5 quanta and $\rm \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}$ = 49 quanta. These values are consistent with those observed in the simulation shown in figure \ref{fig:Kr_ex_Stat}, $\rm \chi_{n_\gamma}$ = 52.6 $\pm$0.6 and $\rm \chi_e$= 50.0 $\pm$ 0.7. 


We now combining the two cases illustrated in figures \ref{fig:Kr_ex_R} and \ref{fig:Kr_ex_Stat}, having recombination only and then detector resolution only. The combined variance projected in $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ can be determined, given a cut in energy. The contribution to variance from the two can be added as they are independent processes.

\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:Chi_total_g} \rm \chi_{n_{\gamma}}^2 = \sigma_{R}^2 + \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 \\
\label{eq:Chi_total_e} \rm \chi_{n_{e}}^2 = \sigma_{R}^2 + \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 \\
\end{alignat}

\noindent where $\rm \sigma_{R}^2$ are the recombination fluctuations, and the values $\rm \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2$ and $\rm \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2$ are given in equation \ref{eq:SigCE_2}. The recombination fluctuation can be measured by rearranging equation \ref{eq:Chi_total_g} and \ref{eq:Chi_total_e} 

\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:SigR_CE_g} \rm \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 = \chi_{n_\gamma}^2 - \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2  \\
\label{eq:SigR_CE_e} \rm \sigma_{R_e}^2 = \chi_{n_e}^2 - \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2
\end{alignat}

Using equations \ref{eq:SigR_CE_g} and \ref{eq:SigR_CE_e} we can extract recombination fluctuations directly from the $\rm n_\gamma$ (S1) and $\rm n_e$ (S2) signals. The quantities $\rm \chi_{n_\gamma}^2$ and  $\rm \chi_{n_e}^2$ are the observables and $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ is determined from calibrations.



\subsection{Application to $\rm^{83}Kr$}

We now have a method to extract recombination fluctuations from data binned in energy in equation \ref{eq:SigR_CE_g} and \ref{eq:SigR_CE_e}. Before applying the method to the tritium beta spectrum we test the method using a \KrCal calibration data set. The result is shown in figure \ref{fig:Kr_ex_Stat} for a bin width of 1 keV, and listed for several bin width in table \ref{table:R_Kr}.

The \KrCal data set contained 400,000 events in the fiducial volume of the detector. Using equations \ref{eq:SigR_CE_g} and \ref{eq:SigR_CE_e} we calculate recombination fluctuations, finding good agreement with the method described for in equation \ref{eq:Dahl}. The agreement between the two methods is within 5\% and implies that the detector resolution has been modeled well. Having demonstrated the method for a line source calibration source the next step is to apply the method outlined in this section to simulated tritium data and see how well the method can extract test values of recombination fluctuations.

Either the observed variance in the light and charge channel can be used to measure the size of recombination fluctuation in a bin of energy. Any asymmetry between the two methods has implications which are discussed in the following subsection.

The total observed variance, $\rm \chi^2$, in the number of photons and electrons considering a bin of combined energy can now be determined transforming equation \ref{eq:SigR} to \ref{eq:Sig_total_CE}.
In equation \ref{eq:Sig_total_CE} we have defined the observed standard deviation in units of quanta $\rm \chi$ for $\rm n_\gamma, n_e$ when working with bins of combined energy. In the limit that F, $\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2$ and $\rm \Delta_E$ go to zero the observed variance in number of photons and electrons ($\rm \chi_{n_\gamma}$ and $\rm \chi_{n_e}$) are related to the size of recombination fluctuations in a given combined energy bin, equation \ref{eq:SigR_CE_lim}. Where $\rm \sigma_R$ is in units of quanta, $\rm \sigma_R = n_i\sigma_r$.

%%.... this equation holds for the standard deviation of a uniform distribution
 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \chi_{n_\gamma}^2 = \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2 + n_iF(r)^2 + \sigma_{r}^2 n_i^2 + \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 \\
\rm \chi_{n_e}^2  = n_iF(1-r)^2 + \sigma_{r}^2 n_i^2 + \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2
\label{eq:Sig_total_CE}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


There are three terms in equation \ref{eq:Sig_total_CE} that give rise to an asymmetry between the observed variance $\rm \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2$  and  $\rm \sigma_{R_e}^2$. The small difference in variance from the slope can be solved for exactly leaving just the Fano factor F and $\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2$. By taking the difference of variance in the two channels component of recombination variance drops out leaving only the Fano factor and the variance in number of excitons, given in equation \ref{eq:Sig_total_CE}.

\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 - \sigma_{R_e}^2 = \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2 + n_iF(2r-1) 
\label{eq:Diff_X}
\end{equation}

F is the Fano factor, equation \ref{eq:Energy_2}, $\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2$ is the variance of the number of excitons produced and r is the recombination fraction, equation \ref{eq:Energy_2}. %The value of $\delta_{Det}$ is the small residual depending on the bin width $\rm \Delta_E$, equation \ref{eq:Residual_Stat}.
%\begin{equation}
%\rm \delta_{Det}= \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 - \sigma_{R_e}^2 = \frac{(1-2M)(W\Delta_E)^2}{12}\\
%\label{eq:Residual_Stat}
%\end{equation}
Consider the case such that variance in the number of excitons $\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2$ is much less than the contribution from the Fano factor. In such a regime we can solve for the Fano factor, potentially energy dependent, from equations \ref{eq:Diff_X}.

\begin{equation}
\rm F(E)=\frac{\sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 - \sigma_{R_e}^2}{n_i(2r-1)}
\begin{cases} \rm r \neq \frac{1}{2}\\
\end{cases}
\label{eq:Fano}
\end{equation}

There is an underlying subtlety to equation \ref{eq:Fano}. Remarkably, in the limit that $\rm \Delta_E$ goes to zero the Fano factor can be extracted with minimal knowledge of intrinsic detector statistical variance. Further, when the statistical variance of S1 and S2 are identical the value of M (equation \ref{eq:Residual_Stat}) will be 0.5. In that special case no knowledge of the statistical variance is needed to measure the Fano factor. 


When $ \rm r = \frac{1}{2}$ the coefficient in front of the Fano factor becomes zero in equation \ref{eq:Diff_X}. At this value an equal contribution from the Fano factor goes into the variance $\rm \chi^2$ of photons and electrons, allowing for the smaller value of $\rm \sigma_{ex}^2$ to be extracted. 

\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2=\sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 - \sigma_{R_e}^2
\begin{cases} \rm r= \frac{1}{2} || \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2 > > n_iF(2r-1)\\
\end{cases}
\label{eq:SigmaEx}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:SigmaEx} is also valid in the case that $\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2$ is much larger than the contribution form the Fano factor. This happens to be true when dealing with the time dependent light yield of $\rm ^{83m}Kr$, this topic will be explored in the next section.



\subsection{Application to $\rm^{83}Kr$}

Using the high stats Kr83 calibration data we can validate the method for working in a bin of energy since the exact solution for recombination and detector fluctuations can be measured, as outlined in section \ref{sec:flucs_mono} and \ref{sec:flucs_mono_bins}. Once the fluctuations from detector resolution are measured in the light and charge channel (S1 and S2 signals), the asymmetry between the two channels can be used to calculate the Fano factor (equation \ref{eq:Sig_total_CE} ). The asymmetry in fluctuations in the light and charge channel arises from the Fano factor acting on ion production which is later amplified through the recombination fraction, as long as the recombination fraction does not equal 0.5. For the case of the $\rm ^{83m}Kr$ calibration the recombination fraction was 0.772 resulting in recombination fluctuations of 3 to 4 more quanta in the light channel as compared to the charge channel, see table \ref{table:R_Kr}. Though the additional recombination fluctuation is small having ample statistics the Fano factor can be constrained. 
The errors in the measurement were derived from simulated Kr data sets of 400,000 events with the Fano factor turned off, using 100 trials. First, recombination fluctuations were turned off and only fluctuations from detector resolution as calculated in section \ref{sec:flucs_mono} were used, see Table \ref{table:Simulated_Sigmas_R_0}. It was found that the error of the difference in recombination fluctuation from the light and charge channel ($\rm sigma_{R_{\gamma}}^2$ and $\sigma_{R_{e}}^2 $) along with the error in ion production and recombination fraction were enough to constrain the Fano factor to 0.001-0.003. Next, the value of recombination was set slightly higher than the actual value of 82 to 100 quanta and the trials were repeated, see table \ref{table:Simulated_Sigmas_R_100}. With the addition of recombination fluctuations to detector resolution fluctuations the error on measuring the Fano factor grew to 0.002-0.009, with smaller bin sizes ($\rm\Delta E$ around the center leading to the smallest error as seen from equation \ref{eq:SigCE_2}.

\subsection{Application to Simulated Tritium Data}

In this section the method outlined in section \ref{sec:flucs_mono_bins} for line sources will be applied to the tritium beta spectrum. To first order, the treatment of a continuous spectrum is identical to the method outlined for \KrCal if we consider that the tritium beta spectrum is comprised of multiple line sources. It will be shown that the formalism developed can be applied to continuous spectra by testing the concepts using simulations. 

As was done for the \KrCal source, we start by simulating a tritium beta spectrum with only recombination fluctuations. Figure \ref{fig:T_R} on the top, shows a tritium beta spectrum propagated at every 1 keV energy bin and on the right from every 0.1 keV.

\end{figure}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{2}

As expected, we find that the recombination fluctuations events along the lines of constant energy. Figure \ref{fig:T_R} is analogous to the illustration shown for the case of \KrCal in figure \ref{fig:Kr_ex_R}. We now add in detector resolution (S1 and S2 fluctuations) and propagate events from every 0.1 keV bin along the tritium spectrum. The detector resolution included is that modeled for the LUX detector. The resulting spectrum is shown in figure \ref{fig:T_R_Stat}.

\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{2}

The recombination fluctuations can now be extracted by plotting the photon and electron populations as a function of energy. The results from the simulation are shown in figure \ref{fig:SIM_LYQY}. By plotting the photon and electron spectra as a function of energy we immediately the effect to recombination fluctuations and detector resolution $\rm \chi_{Det}$, as these cause the fluctuations up and down in constant energy. 


\begin{figure}[h!]\centering

Recombination fluctuations and detector resolution $\rm \chi_{Det}$ move events up and down along lines of constant energy.}
\label{fig:SIM_LYQY}
\end{figure}


\label{sec:Centroid}
Before extracting the recombination fluctuation from the simulated data shown in figure \ref{fig:SIM_LYQY} we must consider the slopes of the population M. The slope of the $\rm n_\gamma$ was defined earlier in equation \ref{eq:Angle} purely as a function of the detector resolution. However, the slope of a continuous spectrum is effected by the functional form of light yield and charge yield as a function of energy.  This issue is easily solved by fitting a line to the population. For this analysis we fit a quadratic to $\rm n_\gamma$ as a function of energy, the slope of the fit is by definition the value of M. Note, for the case of LUX the value of M is dominated by statistical fluctuations and using \ref{fig:SIM_LYQY} is a good approximation.

The quadratic fit to both $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ as a function of energy is used to subtract the centroid of the population calculating the variance in each energy bin. Making the centroid subtraction removes the additional term due to slope and bin width given in \ref{eq:SigCE_2}, allowing us to only dealing with $\rm \chi_{Det}$ without having to keep track of the energy bin size. Recombination fluctuations are calculated by binning the data in energy, extracting the raw variance in $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ in each bin (identical to fitting a Gaussian) and subtracting off $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$, following equation \ref{eq:SigR_CE_e}. The value of  $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ is explicitly, 

\begin{equation}
\footnotesize{\rm \chi_{Det}^2 = M^2\left(\left(1.04\pm_{0.20}^{0.26}\sqrt{n_e}\right)^2+\left(\frac{6.6\pm0.9}{100}n_e\right)^2\right)  +  (M-1)^2\left(\left(3.45\pm_{0.15}^{0.17}\sqrt{n_\gamma}\right)^2+\left(\frac{6.4\pm1.7}{100}n_\gamma\right)^2\right)}  \\
\label{eq:Chi_Explicit}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the values of $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}$ are taken from equation \ref{eq:SigDet} and have been input to equation \ref{eq:Angle}. Note, the value of M for the case of a continuous source should be taken from a fit to the slope of $\rm n_\gamma$ as a function of quanta (E/W). With equation \ref{eq:Chi_Explicit} the value of $\rm \chi_{Det}$ in every energy bin is known, since we  measure the mean value of $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ for each.The result of extracting recombination fluctuations is shown in figure \ref{fig:T_Var} for various energy bin widths.

 We find good agreement between the recombination fluctuations extracted from the simulation to the true value. Importantly, we have demonstrated that the concept of $\rm \chi_{Det}$ that was introduced to deal with fluctuations in energy bins is in fact applicable to a continuous spectrum. We see in figure \ref{fig:T_Var} that $\chi_{Det}$ reduces to the detector resolution of the best quanta collection channel (S2 for LUX). This is exactly what we found from the examples with the \KrCal line source and it is non-trivial that the result would hold for a continuous spectrum. Thus, as long as the recombination fluctuation are greater than $\rm \chi_{Det}$ the value of recombination can be determined to good precision even with a considerable error on $\rm \chi_{Det}$, as the two fluctuations add in quadrature. The analytic solution for extracting recombination outlined in this section is sufficient to first order. We are now ready to apply this method to the tritium calibration data.
 
 %The small deviation around the first and last bins in \rm{fig:T_Var} due to the spectral shape, a correction for spectral shape will be discussed in the next section and will improve the measurement of $\rm \sigma_R$.
 


\section{Extracting Recombination Fluctuations from Tritium Calibration Data}
\label{sec:Recomb_Data}

In this section we apply the methods outlined in this chapter and use them to extract the recombination fluctuations from the tritium data. The first step in this process was calibrate the energy scale solving for $\rm g_1$ and $\rm g_2$ as outlined in \ref{Ch:E_Scale_Cal}. Second, the S1 and S2 signals of the tritium calibration data have been corrected for spectral shape, as will be discussed in chapter \ref{sec:Smear}. Finally, having modeled and measured the statistical and instrumented variances for light collection of the LUX detector \ref{eq:SigDet}, \ref{eq:SigStat}, \ref{eq:SigInst} the amount of fluctuations from detector resolution on each energy contour is known, equation \ref{eq:Chi_Explicit}. 

The events from the tritium calibration data are binned in energy and the mean value of S1 and $\rm S2_b$ is calculated for each. The S1 and S2 signal is converted into mean number of photons and electrons using $\rm g_1$ and $\rm g_2$. Using the mean number of photons and electrons in each bin the value of $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ is calculated using \ref{eq:Chi_Explicit}. Next the total variance in the number of photons and electrons in each energy bin is calculated, defined as $\rm \chi_{n_{\gamma}}^2$ and $\rm \chi_{n_{e}}^2$ respectively. We then solve for $\rm \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{R_e}^2$ given in equation \ref{eq:R_data}, 

\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_R^2 = \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 = \sigma_{R_e}^2 = \chi^2-\chi_{Det}^2
\label{eq:R_data}
\end{equation}
\noindent where the subscripts $\rm \gamma$ and e denote counting photon and electron respectively. The density plot of $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ is shown in figure \ref{fig:Raw_Quanta} and the value of recombination fluctuation is shown in \ref{fig:R_Flucs_Quanta}, for both the 170 V/cm and 100 V/cm data. The 170 V/cm data contained 140,000 tritium beta decays in the fiducial volume and the 100 V/cm data contains 4,500 events.

Also shown is the detector resolution of light collection $\rm \chi_{\sigma_{Det}}$ (blue), charge collection $\rm \sigma_{e_{Det}}$ (cyan), and their manifestation in an energy bin $\rm \chi_{Det}$ (magenta). In regions where the measured recombination fluctuations are larger than the fluctuations from $\rm \chi_{Det}$ any error from the constraint on $\rm g_1$ and $\rm g_2$ is negligible. At the higher energy bins the uncertainty grows as the measurements become statistics limited. The size of the bin to bin fluctuations represent the statistical errors. The figures on the right in \ref{fig:R_Flucs_Quanta} (b: 170 V/cm, d: 100 V/cm) show the total quanta (black) which is the sum of the photons (blue) and electrons (red) and the expected number of ions (magenta) and excitons (cyan), using the exciton-to-ion ratio $\rm \alpha$ = 0.20. Since $\rm \chi_{Det}$ is solved for in terms of photons and electrons the means of the of number of photons and electrons in each energy bin must be measured first.

\subsection{Nuclear and Electronic Recoil Quanta Production}

In figure \ref{fig:R_Flucs_Quanta} b) the quanta produced in terms of photons and electrons for ER events was determined. From those observables (light and charge) the initial number of ions and excitons produced was modeled assuming $\rm \alpha$ = 0.2. Here we will demonstrate the difference between an ER and NR event of equal energy in liquid xenon. As outlined in section \ref{sec:NR}, nuclear recoil events lose about half their energy to heat given by the energy dependent Lindhard factor. NR events also have shorter track lengths which causes the recombination fraction to be less sensitive to energy compared to ER events \cite{Dahl_Thesis}. Further, the exciton-to-ion ratio for an NR event is $\sim$ 1 compared to $\sim$ 0.2 for ER. Thus, there is more light than charge produced for a given NR event as compared to an ER event. These properties are what allow for background rejection in liquid xenon detectors. Figure \ref{fig:ER_NR_Comp} (left) shows the quanta production for electron recoils at 170 V/cm measured from the tritium data compared to the expected values for nuclear recoils (right). The comparison is made in the LUX WIMP search region of interest from 1 to 8 keV. The nuclear recoil equivalent was determined using data from \cite{Dahl_Thesis}.

\subsection{Extracting Recombination fraction From Tritium Data}

Having measured the mean number of photons and electrons in each bin, the recombination probability $\rm r_p$ can be determined by taking the average value of recombination, given in \ref{eq:recomb_frac}. Figure \ref{fig:R_T} shows the measurement of the recombination fraction r for the 170 V/cm and 100 V/cm tritium calibration data. The value \rp, or $\rm \left<r\right>$, defines the mean location of the ER band and is fundamental to the liquid xenon, at a given energy and electric field. The shaded region represents the one sigma of the recombination fraction, which can be thought of in terms of the recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma_r = \sigma_R / n_{ions} $. We find that the bands at 100 V/cm and 170 V/cm converge below 4 $\rm keV_{ee}$ meaning that the light yields and charge yields also converge (discussed in chapter \ref{Ch:LYQY}). Having extracted the apparent recombination probability $\rm r_p$ we can begin to think about recombination fluctuations in terms of a binomial process where an electron ion pair will either recombine or not with probability \rp.

\end{figure}

\newpage

\subsection{Modeling the ER Band}

The ultimate goal of this chapter, and the tritium calibrations, is to be able to make predictions about WIMP sensitivity at various electric fields in the WIMP search energies of interest, 1-5 $\rm keV_{ee}$. Having extracted \rp and the recombination fluctuations, we have the ability to reconstruct the electronic recoil band for liquid xenon as it would appear with infinite detector resolution. Starting with the recombination fluctuations, which are fundamental to the xenon, the base ER band can be modeled by adding the resolution of any detector. Using the mean and width of the ER band along with the mean of the NR band we can make predictions for WIMP background rejection.  

The mean of the ER band in the commonly used discrimination variable $\rm  log_{10}(S2_b/S1)$ can be written as a function of number of ions,
\begin{equation}
\rm log_{10}(S2_b/S1) = log_{10} \left(\frac{(1-r)N_i}{(r+\alpha)N_i}\right) + log_{10}\left(\frac{g_2}{g_1}\right)
\label{eq:Band_Mean}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the observed charge and light signals $\rm S2_b$ and S1 have been converted to recombination probability r,  number of ions $\rm N_i$ and the exciton to ion ratio $\rm \alpha$ using equations \ref{eq:Gain1}, \ref{eq:Gain2} and \ref{eq:Energy_2}. The variance of the band can be written as,
\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{log_{10}(S2_b/S1)} = \frac{1}{\left(log(10)\right)^2} \times \sigma_R^2 \left( \frac{ - (\alpha+1) }{(1-r)(r+\alpha)N_i} \right)^2
\label{eq:Band_Var}
\end{equation}

\noindent Which has been written in terms of the number of ions $\rm N_i$, the recombination fraction r, and the measured recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma_R$, defined to be $\rm \sigma_r\times N_i$. The result of the ER band's mean population and its corresponding 1 sigma fluctuation are shown in figure \ref{fig:ER_Band_Calc} for the case of 100 V/cm (blue) and 170 V/cm (black). This result shows the ER band with recombination fluctuations only. One can add light and charge collection fluctuations in quadrature to complete the modeling specific to any detector.

The exciton-to-ion ratio is assumed to be $\rm \alpha =$ 0.20. We find an overlap below 4 $\rm keV_{ee}$ where the additional strength of the drift field is higher improving threshold of discrimination. Above 4 $\rm keV_{ee}$ the band separate as the higher drift field increased the charge extraction leading to better discrimination.}

\section{Measuring Alpha From the Tritium Data}

Having measured $\rm r_p$ and $\rm \sigma_r$ from the tritium calibration data the exciton to ion ratio $\rm \alpha$ determined by requiring that as the number of ions tends to one the recombination fluctuations tend to that of a binomial process. This is justified, as at low energies the handful of ion-electron pairs will either recombine or not with recombination probability $\rm r_p$. Such a process has a binomial variance written as,
\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{Bino}= (1-r_p)r_p N_i
\label{eq:Bino_Var}
\end{equation}

\noindent where \rp is the recombination probability and $\rm N_i$ is the number of ions which can be thought of as the number of trials for the binomial process. 

The value of alpha can be extracted by requiring that the recombination fluctuations $\rm \sigma_R^2$ tend to that of equation \ref{eq:Bino_Var} for a small number of ions. In figure \ref{fig:Alpha_T} the y axis shows the ratio of the measured recombination standard deviation( $\rm \sigma_R$) to the standard deviation of a purely binomial process. The plot on the left shows the expected binomial standard deviation on the x axis. The best alpha is one in which the observed standard deviation converges with that of a binomial process as the binomial variance tends to 1. The figure on the right has the number of ions available for recombination on the x axis. As the number of ions approaches one the standard deviation of recombination should become that of a binomial process. A single ion will either recombine or not with probability r.  The extrapolation is made by fitting the lowest energy bins above 90\% threshold 1.3 to 3 keV. Going below the value of one on the y axis implies that recombining electron-ion pairs have a variance better than binomial, which is nonphysical if it is a random process. The best intercept converging to a purely binomial process is with $\alpha$ = 0.18$\pm 0.02$, consistent with the measurement in \cite{Doke_alpha} and not 0.06 as used in \cite{Dahl_Thesis}. Note, for this analysis we continue to use $\rm \alpha = 0.20$ as measured by \cite{Doke_alpha}.

\section{Extracting Recombination Fluctuations from $\rm ^{137}Cs$ Calibration}

To expand the picture of recombination fluctuation to higher energies the same method used for the tritium calibration was applied to Compton scatters from an external $\rm ^{137}Cs$ calibration source. The $\rm ^{137}Cs$ source provides ER calibration data from the back-scatter peak around 150 keV to the photo peak at 662 keV. Figure \ref{fig:Cs_LYQYR} on the left shows the measured mean number of photons, electron in each energy bin along with their one sigma fluctuation (shaded). The number of excitons and ions are also show assuming an $\alpha$ = 0.20. Once the mean number of photons and electrons are measured the recombination probability is determined and plotted on the right in figure \ref{fig:Cs_LYQYR}. The inflection around 662 keV is due to the sharp rise and fall of the photo peak skewing the measurement of number of photons and electrons.

\section{Recombination Fluctuations, The Bigger Picture}
We have now measured the recombination probability and fluctuation over a wide range of energies and at two fields for tritium (100 and 170 V/cm). The calibrations range from the 1.0 keV with tritium to about 700 keV with $\rm^{137}Cs$, and include the line sources used for the energy scale calibration in chapter \ref{Ch:E_Scale_Cal} given in table \ref{table:Cal_lines}. We also use data from a  $\rm ^{57}Co$ calibration at a variety of electric fields ranging from 60 to 5000 V/cm from a test detector\cite{Dahl_Thesis}. 

The picture of the recombination process in liquid xenon is that it is binomial, essentially each electron-ion pair in an independent trial. The observed recombination fraction is thought to the result of each electron-ion pair either recombining or not with some probability \rp, \cite{NEST_2013}, \cite{Thomas_Imel}, \cite{Birks}. Though the modeling has been able to reproduce the recombination fraction, it has failed by orders of magnitude to reproduce the variance, as shown in figure \ref{fig:R_Big}. For a binomial system, given a recombination probability \rp the variance is

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{Bino}= (1-r_p)r_pN_i
\label{eq:Bino_Var2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm Var_{Bino}$ represents the binomial variance, \rp is the recombination probability, and $\rm N_i$ is the number of ions and also the number of trials.

 Figure \ref{fig:R_Big} shows $\rm \sigma_R$ plotted the number of ions available for recombination $\rm N_i$. The x-axis is chosen to be number of ions as recombination fluctuations only act on ions and not excitons. The conversion to energy on the x axis is $\rm E = W\times n_i (1 + \alpha ) $. The black dashed line in the figure on the right shown the expected standard deviation for a binomial process.

Top: Black dashed lines represent the values expected from a binomial process and the green line is a fit to the data with a constant amplification given in equation \ref{eq:Bino_Amp}.

\label{fig:R_Big}
\end{figure}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{2}
\small\normalsize

 The data suggests that the size of the standard deviation $\rm \sigma_R$ grows linearly with respect to the number of ions. We fit to two cases, first assuming a ``Binomial Amplification", $\rm \mathcal{A}$, described by
 
 \begin{equation}
 \rm \sigma_R^2 = Var_{Bino}\times \mathcal{A}N_i
 \label{eq:Bino_Amp}
 \end{equation}
 
 \noindent where $\rm \sigma_R^2$ is the measured recombination fluctuation in $\rm quanta^2$, $\rm N_i$ is the number of ions, $\rm \mathcal{A}$ is a constant and $\rm Var_{Bino}$ is from equation \ref{eq:Bino_Var2}. We find from figure \ref{fig:R_Big} that the data is fit to within 30\% over the entire energy range with with a constant value of $\rm \mathcal{A}$ = 0.022.  
 
 There is no physical justification for the fit in figure \ref{fig:R_Big} to the apparent binomial variance amplification, $\rm \mathcal{A}$. Instead we fit a line to the standard deviation as a function of number of ions, described by 
 
  \begin{equation}
 \rm \sigma_R^2 = (\mathcal{C}N_i)^2
 \label{eq:stdev_lin}
 \end{equation}
 
 \noindent where $\rm \mathcal{C}$ is the constant ratio of observed standard deviation, $\rm \sigma_R$, to the number of ions, $\rm N_i$. The value of $\rm \mathcal{C}$ is found to be 0.073. So the recombination fluctuations (the variance) appears to be growing like $\rm \frac{1}{185}\times N_i^2$.
 
The $\rm N_i^2$ growth suggested by the data means there is a flaw in our recombination picture. The observed variance deviated from binomial by a factor of $\rm N_{ions}$. There is another issue with the picture of electron-ion self recombination. The decline of recombination probability as the energy (or $\rm N_i$) tends to zero is nonphysical, yet is observed in the data, shown in figure \ref{fig:R_T}. The probability of the electron ion-pair to recombine should be insensitive to the number of electron-ion pairs created by the energy deposit. It is found that both ER and NR fluctuations can be well described by equation \ref{eq:stdev_lin} \cite{NEST_2013}. Curiously, the exciton to ion ratio $\rm \alpha$ and the initial energy lost to heat for an NR is vastly different than for an ER event. This suggests something fundamental occurring during the recombination process that depends on the number of ions produced. 

The the additional $\rm N_i$ term in the variance may be arising from an additional term in the recombination probability that allows for electrons to recombine with ions other than their own. Even a small term for an ``encounter probability" could give rise to the correct variance \cite{Mozumder}. The idea seems justified by observations from the \KrCal source. The decay of the calibration source \KrCal has been observed to receive an enhancement of several percent in the light yield of the second 9.4 keV following the first decay of 32.1 keV \cite{Start_Kr}. This can be attributed to the second decay occurring surrounded by a cluster of charge from the first decay, resulting in an enhanced encounter recombination probability and increased light yield. The shorter the timing separation between the two decays the greater the light yield enhancement, with light yield enhancement observed past 1000 ns \cite{Kastens}, \cite{Baudis}. LUX data shows enhancement out to 2000 ns, as shown in figure \ref{fig:Yield_Kr9}. This lends evidence that freed electrons can be attracted to ions while diffusing from the interaction site on the time scales of hundreds of nano seconds. However, even with a small encounter probability one finds that for large values of $\rm N_i$ all the electron-ion pairs would annihilate, which is inconsistent with the observed recombination fraction. Perhaps a careful consideration of clustering could resolve this.

Another potential source of the fluctuation is the event to event variation of the exciton-to-ion ratio $\rm \alpha$, which we have taken to be 0.20. If we allow for variations in the number of excitons of each track produced to fluctuate as $\rm \alpha$ = 0.2 $\pm$ 0.09 we would reproduce the correct variance. However, having the sigma of the number of excitons produced fixed to the mean values also seems nonphysical.

The growth of the variance as $\rm \frac{1}{185} N_i^2$ suggest that events may be being drawn from a narrow uniform distribution. We would like to improve upon the current NEST model \cite{NEST_2013} to be able reproduce both mean recombination fraction and also the correct variance from first principles. In future calibration, tritium calibration data taken at a wide range of fields may aid in producing better modeling.

\subsection{Encounter Recombination Probability}

The apparent amplification of the ER fluctuations over that of a binomial process is troubling. What causes the ER events to be so erratic over their nuclear recoil counterparts which can be well described by binomial fluctuation \cite{Dahl_Thesis}. The key difference that lends a clue to solving the puzzle is that for a given energy nuclear recoils will produce significantly less election-ion pairs. It has been observed for ER events that as the number of ions goes to one the recombination fluctuations do indeed become more binomial like, shown in figure \ref{fig:Alpha_T}. Before we move on, it should be noted that the method outlined in this section will succeed in explaining recombination fluctuation but will fail to reproduce the recombination fraction probability. This subsection is meant as a discussion on encounter recombination probability.

We introduce a new term into the recombination fraction, encounter recombination probably $\rm r_\epsilon$. The term $\rm r_\epsilon$ couples freed electrons to ions other than its own. There are well motivated arguments to be made to include a $\rm r_\epsilon$ term. First, in liquid xenon the decay of the calibration source \KrCal has been observed to receive an enhancement of several percent in the light yield of the second 9.4 keV following the first decay of 32.1 keV \cite{Start_Kr}. This can be attributed to the second decay occurring surrounded by a ball of charge from the first decay resulting in an enhanced encounter recombination probability and increased light yield. The two \KrCal decays are separated by a half life to 154 ns \cite{83Kr_HalfLife_1}. The shorter the timing separation between the two decays the greater the light yield enhancement, with light yield enhancement observed past 1000 ns \cite{Kastens}, \cite{Baudis}. LUX data shows enhancement out to 2000 ns, in figure \ref{fig:Yield_Kr9}.This lends evidence that freed electrons can be attracted to ions while diffusing from the interaction site on the time scales of hundreds of nano seconds. The idea of encounter probability was worked out by Mozumder noting the need for encounter recombination probabilities of 0.01 in order to explain the ion production rate in liquid xenon \cite{Mozumder}. 

In this subsection we set out to model the variations resulting from the recombination probability containing a component from encounter recombination probability. Once the model for variance is worked out we can fit to the tritium and $\rm^{137}Cs$ calibration data in order to extract the encounter recombination probability. 

First we start with expression for the variance of a binomial process with some recombination probability r. 

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_r= (1-r)rN_i
\label{eq:Bino_Var2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm N_i$ is the number of ions, and can be thought of as the number of trials. Next we split the total observed recombination probability into two components.

\begin{equation}
\rm r=r_s + r_\epsilon
\label{eq:rs}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm r_s$ is the self recombination probability and $\rm r_\epsilon$ is the encounter recombination probability. The expectation is that  $\rm r_\epsilon << r_s$, \cite{Mozumder}. The variance resulting from the two terms can be considered as independent processes occurring subsequently thus, the total variance of the process is the the sum of the individual variances for each ion. In our modeling every free electron has an average encounter probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ with each ion. The variance of $\rm N_i$ ions is given in equation \ref{eq:Bino_Var2} and is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Fig} for the case of one ion. At this point we pause to point out the fatal fall in this theory. As the number of ion-electron pairs grow all ions will recombine as each ion is unable to avoid recombination from the bombardment of $\rm N_i$ electrons. The observed recombination probability for this process becomes $\rm r=r_s + N_i\cdot r_\epsilon$. With that note, we proceed to learn more about encounter recombination probability.

\caption{Illustration of recombination for the case of a in single ion, blue box highlighted in black at the center. The total recombination probability for one ion is the combination of the the dominant self recombination probability ($\rm r_s$) plus the sum of the encounter recombination probabilities ($\rm r_\epsilon$) from the remaining N-1 electrons. This process is repeated for N number of ion electron pairs leading to a binomial variance given in equation \ref{eq:Var_s}. }
\label{fig:Flucs_Fig}
\end{figure}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{2}

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{(r_s + r_\epsilon)} = \sum\limits_{N_i}r_s(1-r_s) + \sum\limits_{N_i} r_\epsilon(1-r_\epsilon)(N_i-1)
\label{eq:Var_s}
\end{equation}

\noindent the first term of equation \ref{eq:Var_s} is the binomial variance of a single electron-ion pair with some probability $\rm r_s$ to recombine. The second term is the binomial variance of the average encounter probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ with all other electrons excluding its own escaped electron, a total of ($\rm N_i$-1). Both terms are summed over all possible ions, accounting for all $\rm N_i$ ions with $\rm N_i -1$ electrons available to be encountered. Due to the relatively slow mobility of ions vs electrons, the ions are treated as fixed with the freed electrons having some probability of encounter an ion. This is a simplistic model that treats the encounter probability as an overall average for all electron-ion pair combinations. Assuming $\rm N_i$ is large equation \ref{eq:Var_s} can be simplified to 

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{(r_s + r_\epsilon)} = r_s(1-r_s)N_i + r_\epsilon(1-r_\epsilon)N_i^2
\label{eq:Var_s2}
\end{equation}

The result of splitting the recombination probability into self and encounter recombination is subtle, yet has huge implications. Comparing equation \ref{eq:Bino_Var2} to \ref{eq:Var_s} we find that the binomial variance of the process with encounter recombination probability will grow like $\rm N_i^2$ as opposed to the binomial variance of a self recombination process that grows like $\rm N_i$. To better understand the amplification of the binomial fluctuation observed in the data, figure \ref{fig:R_Big}, we define an amplification term as the ratio of the binomial variance with encounter recombination probability to that of a binomial process with self recombination probability r.

\begin{equation}
\rm \mathcal{A}= \frac{Var_{(r_s + r_\epsilon)}}{Var_r}
\label{eq:Amp}
\end{equation}

\noindent $\rm Var_{(r_s + r_\epsilon)}$ and $\rm Var_r$ are given in equations \ref{eq:Var_s2} and \ref{eq:Bino_Var2}, respectively. 


We will treat two cases. First, we will assume that $\rm r_\epsilon << r_s$ and $\rm r_s \simeq r$. Second, we will hold the ratio of $\rm r_\epsilon/r$ to be a constant. The second case is motivated by the idea that electric field and energy dependence that governs self recombination probability also applies to encounter recombination probability.

The amplification of the binomial variance from equation \ref{eq:Amp} is

\begin{equation}
\rm \mathcal{A} =\frac{N_i}{N_i} \left( \frac{ r_s(1-r_s) + r_\epsilon(1-r_\epsilon)N_i }{ r(1-r) } \right)
\label{eq:Amp_S1}
\end{equation}

\noindent assuming that $\rm r_\epsilon << r_s$ and $\rm r_s \simeq r$ equation \ref{eq:Amp_S1} can be simplified to, 

\begin{equation}
\rm \mathcal{A} =\left(1 +  \frac{ r_\epsilon(1-r_\epsilon)N_i }{ r(1-r) } \right)
\label{eq:Amp_S2}
\end{equation}
 
\noindent  Using equation \ref{eq:Amp_S2} the value of encounter recombination probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ can be extracted from the tritium and $\rm^{137}Cs$ data using $\rm N_i$, r, and $\rm \mathcal{A}$.  Where the value of binomial amplification $\rm \mathcal{A}$ is the extracted from the data defined as the recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma_R$ over $\rm \sigma_R$-binomial, shown in figure \ref{fig:R_Big}. The result of extracting encounter recombination probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ is shown in figure \ref{fig:Encounter_R_Const}. The overall average of  $\rm r_\epsilon$ from the calibration data is $\rm r_\epsilon$ = 0.0042 varying from 0.002 to 0.007, in good agreement with Mozumder \cite{Mozumder}.

\newpage

Taking the value of $\rm r_\epsilon$ as a constant of 0.0042 we find that the observed ER recombination fluctuations are in fact consistent with binomial fluctuation at our field of 170 and 100 V/cm, shown later in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Model}. This is a step in the right direction for understanding recombination fluctuations. Our data is limited to only two electric fields at 100 and 170 V/cm making it difficult to model field dependence. To expand the model we include data from Dahl, using a $\rm ^{57}Co$ source with fields ranging from 60 to 5000 V/cm \cite{Dahl_Thesis}. We then extract $\rm r_\epsilon$, shown as the black points in figure \ref{fig:Encounter_R_All}.

The data from Dahl, shown in \ref{fig:Encounter_R_All}, provides good motivation to proceed with our second assumption, modeling the ratio of $\rm r_\epsilon/r$ to be a constant. There appears to be correlation between the recombination probability and the encounter recombination probability. This correlation is sensible, considering that as the electric field is increased the freed electrons can escape the ions more readily. Thus, both the self and encounter recombination decline as a function of applied electron field. However, the assumption that $\rm r_\epsilon$ and r are always correlated is to be taken with a grain of salt, and is not supported by the tritium data. Between 2.5 and 10 keV the recombination probability r and $\rm r_\epsilon$ become anti-correlated. With that caveat mentioned, we proceed with the second case.

\begin{equation}
\rm r_\epsilon = r_{\epsilon_0} + \mathcal{C} r
\label{eq:Case_2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm \mathcal{C}$ is a constant linking the observed recombination probability r to $\rm r_\epsilon$. The best fit for both cases is show in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Model}. Case one, is with a global average of $\rm r_\epsilon$= 0.0042, extracted from the tritium and $\rm^{137}Cs$ data. Case two, is using $\rm r_\epsilon$ = 0.0011 + 0.006r. The fit for case one is within 30\% when excluding the data from Dahl, and the fit the second case deviates less than 30\% from all of the data.

The simplistic model outlined in this subsection demonstrates that recombination fluctuation of electronic recoil can indeed be the result of binomial statistics. Remarkably, a sub 1\% component of recombination probability r from encounter probability leads to an apparent binomial amplification factor of 1 to 1000, shown in the right plot in figure \ref{fig:R_Big}. The tiny value of $\rm r_\epsilon$ makes a significant impact when considering the combinatorics of the recombination process. This is good progress, we have found a simplistic was to gain an additional factor of $\rm N_i$ for recombination fluctuations vs. energy, instead of applying a power law fit to binomial amplification with no physical basis. However, we still need to clean up the problem of total ion-electron pair recombination resulting from such a model. We have found the correct variance but have failed to produced the correct recombination probability. The fix the the issue is described in the next subsection.


\subsection{Clusters of Encounter Recombination}

In the previous subsection a model was introduced which could predict the observed recombination fluctuations of ER events. However, the model failed to produce the correct recombination probability. We found that as the energy (or $\rm N_i$) rises the recombination probability tends to 1, and beyond as $\rm r=r_s + N_i\cdot r_\epsilon$. The zeroth order correction to this problem is to remove the self recombination term $\rm r_s$ and treat self recombination as just another encounter recombination probability, $\rm r_s=r_\epsilon$. Next, we will not allow the full $\rm N_i$ electrons to interact with each ion as this is nonphysical. Instead, only a small number of the total ions $\rm N_\epsilon$ are allowed to have encounters for each energy deposit, illustrated in \ref{fig:Flucs_Fig}. The value of $\rm N_\epsilon$ is set by the requirement to reproduce the correct recombination probability. The observed recombination probability r is then written as,

\begin{equation}
\rm r=r_s+(N_\epsilon-1) r_\epsilon = N_\epsilon r_\epsilon
\label{eq:Simp1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where r is the observed recombination probability at a given energy, $\rm r_s$ is the self recombination probability taken to be equal to the encounter recombination probability $\rm r_\epsilon$, and $\rm N_\epsilon$ is the average number of electron encounters for each ion. Note that the value of $\rm N_\epsilon$ used is an average and can also vary event to event depending on the ER track geometry. The equation for recombination probability in \ref{eq:Simp1} inadvertently solves the other issue of the original recombination model. By taking self recombination $\rm r_s$ to be equal to $\rm r_\epsilon$ the observed recombination probability r naturally vanishes as the energy ($\rm N_i$) tends to zero, as observed in the data shown in figure \ref{fig:R_T}. The binomial variance of such a process is,

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} = (1-N_\epsilon r_\epsilon)N_\epsilon r_\epsilon N_i
\label{eq:SimpVar}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} $ is the recombination variance in number of quanta squared for a given interaction with $\rm N_i$ ions, encounter recombination probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ with an average of $\rm N_\epsilon$ encounters. The variance derived in equation \ref{eq:SimpVar} grown like $\rm N_i$ and suffers the same problem as our original model. The variance needs to grow like $\rm N_i^2$ to explain the observed recombination fluctuations in the data, as seen in the previous subsection. 

The solution is surprisingly straight forward considering the two requirements. First, in order to maintain the correct recombination probability r the value of  encounter interactions $\rm N_\epsilon$ must be fixed. Second, to get the additional factor of $\rm N_i$ in variance the process of size  $\rm N_\epsilon$ must be be repeated, with the repetition scaling like $\rm N_i$. Remember, we are only allowing a small number, $\rm N_\epsilon$, of the total ions available ions to have encounters. Consider the picture in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Fig} but for $\rm N_\epsilon$ encounters repeated $\rm N_i/N_\epsilon$ times in $\rm N_C$ clusters, such a process is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Fig_Cluster}. The number of clusters $\rm N_C$ for a given in equation \ref{eq:N_C}. 

\begin{equation}
\rm N_C = N_i/N_\epsilon
\label{eq:N_C}
\end{equation}

The process is repeated for $\rm N_C$ clusters, resulting in and additional factor $\rm N_i$ in the observed variance while maintaining the correct average recombination probability r. }

The value $\rm N_\epsilon$ can be considered as the number of encounters per cluster, or generalized to the number of ions per cluster. The electron-ion pairs have $\rm N_\epsilon$ encounters in each cluster with an average recombination probability r. The total recombination probability of the system of clusters remains equal to $\rm r=\rm N_\epsilon r_\epsilon$ without blowing up to unity. Since the process is repeated for $\rm N_C$ clusters the variance from equation \ref{eq:SimpVar} becomes

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} =  \sum\limits_{N_C}(1-N_\epsilon r_\epsilon)N_\epsilon r_\epsilon N_i
\label{eq:SimpVar_C}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} $ is the recombination variance of equation \ref{eq:SimpVar} for $\rm N_C$ clusters. Plugging in the value of $\rm N_C$ from equation \ref{eq:N_C} we find

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} =  (1-N_\epsilon r_\epsilon)N_\epsilon r_\epsilon N_i (N_i/N_\epsilon)
\label{eq:SimpVar_C}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the multiplication by $\rm N_C$ is written as $\rm N_i/N_\epsilon$. Further simplifying equation \ref{eq:SimpVar_C} and recalling that $\rm r=N_\epsilon r_\epsilon$,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} =  (1-N_\epsilon r_\epsilon) r_\epsilon N_i^2 \\
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} =  (1-r) r_\epsilon N_i^2 \\
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} =  (1-r) r \frac{N_i^2}{N_\epsilon} 
\end{split}
\label{eq:SimpVar_C_2}
\end{equation}

\noindent Taking the result for variance given in equation \ref{eq:SimpVar_C_2} we calculate the apparent amplification factor $\rm \mathcal{A}$ over that of a binomial process, our original recombination theory. 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \mathcal{A} = \frac{Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon}}{Var_{r}} = \frac{(1-r)r N_i^2/N\epsilon}{(1-r)rN_i} \\
%\rm \mathcal{A} = \frac{r_\epsilon N_i}{r} \\
\rm \mathcal{A} = \frac{N_i}{N_\epsilon} = N_C
\end{split}
\label{eq:Simp_Amp}
\end{equation}

\noindent the amplification factor in equation \ref{eq:Simp_Amp} remarkably simple. The amplification over that of a binomial process reduces to the number of clusters $\rm N_C$. Note, the value of $\rm N_\epsilon$ is the ratio of $\rm r/r_\epsilon$. This is the key to the cluster recombination model. We have picked up an additional factor $\rm N_i$ in the variance while maintaining the correct average recombination probability r. Using equation \ref{eq:Simp_Amp} we can extract the encounter probability $\rm r_\epsilon$, the cluster size $\rm N_\epsilon$ and the number of clusters $\rm N_C$ from our calibration data.

The average value of $\rm r_\epsilon$ over a wide range of energies is found to be 0.01, shown in figure \ref{fig:Simple_re}. The value of  $\rm r_\epsilon$ determined by using the cluster-encounter model is consistent with that noted by Mozumder in 1995 to explain ion fluctuations in liquid xenon \cite{Mozumder}. The value of  $\rm r_\epsilon=0.01$ corresponds to an average value of encounters $\rm N_\epsilon = 50$, which can be thought of as the cluster size. Figure \ref{fig:Simple_re} (c) also shows the number of clusters vs. energy, which grows linearly with $\rm N_i$.  Note, the number of clusters is the factor by which the binomial fluctuations of the initial self-recombination model are amplified at at given energy.


The number of interaction per cluster $\rm N_\epsilon$, or cluster size, sets the encounter probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ in this model. The value of $\rm N_\epsilon$ appears to level off around 25 as energy tends to zero and varies between 25 to 100 over a wide range of energies and electric fields. Both $\rm r_\epsilon$ and $\rm N_\epsilon$ appear to have dependencies on electric field and energy . Which is not surprising as both the track geometry and interaction probability depend on electric field and energy. The data from Dahl over the range of 60 to 5000 V/cm especially illuminates the dependencies vs. field. We proceed with a simplified model and take the value of  $\rm N_\epsilon$ as a constant. The average value of $\rm N_\epsilon =50$ is used to calculate the expected variance at each energy using equation \ref{eq:Simp_Amp}, the result is shown in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Simple}.

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Simple} shows the measured recombination fluctuations vs. energy along with that expected for the clustering model given in equation \ref{eq:SimpVar_C_2}, for $\rm N_\epsilon =50 $, corresponding to an average encounter recombination probability of $\rm r_\epsilon = 0.01$. The deviation of the fit and the data is less than 30\%, including Dahl's data taken at electric fields ranging from 60 to 5000 V/cm. 

With the clustered encounter model we can now account for the recombination fluctuations and understand why recombination tends to zero as energy tends to zero. Having explained these two phenomena, the clustered-encounter model is a significant improvement over the initial recombination model. The flaw of the initial recombination model was to assume that the recombination process only consists of ion-electron pair self recombination. This assumption is what lead to the observed variance being off by a factor of $\rm N_i$ and the inability to explain the dependence of recombination fraction as energy tends to zero. The picture of ER band mean and width is now complete, only requiring recombination fraction r as an input. The recombination fraction is dependent on the energy of the interaction and electric field, modeled by Thomas \& Imel \cite{Thomas_Imel} and NEST \cite{NEST}, \cite{NEST_2013}.

\section{Conclusion}

%This should be the conclusion after showing the ER band and alpha...

There have been numerous steps in this chapter culminating in expanding our knowledge by extracting as much information as possible from the calibration sources. We have described statistical fluctuations in the S1 and S2 signal which result from detector resolution. Next, line sources were used to extract recombination fluctuations and the instrumental component of signal fluctuations. Finally, we discuss the methodology to extract recombination from continual sources and use it for the tritium and $\rm ^{137}Cs$ data.

The best fit to the exciton-to-ion ratio was found to be $\rm \alpha$ of 0.18 $\pm$ 2, consistent with the measurement from \cite{Doke_alpha}. The value of alpha was constrained by extrapolating the recombination fluctuations from the tritium data from 3 to 1.2 keV and requiring that for a single ion-electron pair the fluctuation be purely binomial, shown in figure \ref{fig:Alpha_T}.

The recombination data measured in this section can be used to predict the ER band for any xenon detector (at 170 V/cm), as shown in figure \ref{fig:ER_Band_Calc}. %The most critical results are those specific to our WIMP search, 10-100 GeV WIMP, focused in the range of 1 to 5 $\rm keV_{ee}$. %Having extracted the values of r and $\rm \sigma_r$ for ER events the generic mean and band widths can be determined. Thus, the ER band shape can be determined for any xenon detector with the application of the additional variance from the specific detector resolution. The knowledge of this band shape can be used to make predictions about the background rejection power of a given experiment. 
It is surprising to find that changing the drift filed from 100 V/cm to 170 V/cm had only a small impact on the mean of ER band below 4 $\rm keV_{ee}$, figure \ref{fig:ER_Band_Calc}. Further, there was no impact on the energy threshold since the light and charge yields merge at the threshold of 1 keV. A more dramatic field dependence was expected from \cite{Dahl_Thesis} and \cite{NEST_2013}. To expand upon the modeling of the recombination process in xenon, at low energies, it will be useful for the next science run using the LUX detector to take tritium calibration data at a variety of fields. % predict exactly how much additional NR and ER discrimination can be achieved by increasing the field.

%However, the low energy region never been probed to such high precision as with the tritium calibration using the LUX detector. To expand upon the modeling, at low energies, it will be useful for the next science run using the LUX detector to take tritium calibration data at a verity of fields. This will allow us to predict exactly how much additional NR and ER discrimination can be achieved by increasing the field. %We also want to explore if the recombination fluctuation can truly be thought of an an amplification of the variance over that of the underlying binomial process of electron-ion pair recombination.
