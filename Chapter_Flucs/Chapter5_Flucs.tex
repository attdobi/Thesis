\chapter{Event Level Fluctuations}
\label{Ch:Flucs}

In this chapter we discuss extracting recombination fluctuations from line sources and continuous spectrum such as tritium. The method outlined will be used to measure recombination fluctuations from the tritium calibration data down to 1 keV. We begin by modeling the intrinsic resolution of the LUX detector, based on counting statistics. We then separate the fluctuations in light and charge collection from recombination fluctuations using line source calibrations. Once the variances from light and charge collection are modeled the recombination fluctuations from continuous spectra can be extracted, specifically for the tritium beta spectrum. We conclude with the results for recombination and recombination fluctuations as measured from tritium beta decay in the LUX detector along with a measure of the exciton-to-ion ratio $\rm \alpha$ for ER events.


\section{Modeling Intrinsic Detector Resolution}

Intrinsic statistical fluctuations in light and charge (S1 and S2) collection in the LUX detector lead to a spread in collected quanta. To measure effects from recombination fluctuations and the Fano factor, we must first decouple the detector component of resolution. We use the model described in \cite{Platzman} \cite{Dahl_Thesis} in which the measured scintillation and ionization signals (S1 and S2 measured in PE) are related to the number of photons and electrons by gains g1 and g2, equation \ref{eq:Gain1} and \ref{eq:Gain2}. Specifically, the average number of photons and electrons produced for a given energy deposit are proportional to the average S1 and S2 signals.

\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:Gain1} \rm  \left<n_\gamma\right> = \frac{\left<S1\right>}{g_1}\\
\label{eq:Gain2} \rm \left<n_{e}\right> = \frac{\left<S2\right>}{g_2}
\end{alignat}

\noindent where the gain g1 represents photon detection efficiency, the probability of a photon from an energy deposit striking a PMT and producing a photo electron signal (PE), depending on geometry and the quantum efficiency of the PMTs. Gain g2 represents the average S2 signal of a single electron multiplied by the electron extraction efficiency ($\rm \epsilon$) of the liquid gas interface, where S2 uses only the bottom PMT array and is corrected for electron-lifetime. The fluctuations in photons and electrons are related to the observables S1 and S2 by equations \ref{eq:Gain1} and \ref{eq:Gain2}

\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:Sig1} \rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_{S1_{stat}}^2}{g_1^2}\\
\label{eq:Sig2} \rm \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_{S2_{stat}}^2}{g_2^2}
\end{alignat}

\noindent where $\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}}^2$ represent the variance in the average number of measured photons and electrons, respectively. The variances in S1 and S2, $\sigma_{S1_{stat}}^2$ and $\sigma_{S2_{stat}}^2$, are the observable quantities with the detector. The variance in terms of quanta ($\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$) must be considered interns of the PE being counted by the detector. 

The statistical variance of the S1 signal, in equation \ref{eq:Sig1}, can be broken into two linearly independent parts. First a binomial variance, the S1 signal fluctuates due to the light collection probability g1. For each event there are $\rm n_\gamma$ number of PE to be collected by the PMTs with probability g1 of collecting each. Here, $\rm n_\gamma$ should be thought of as the number of trials.  number of trials is,
\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{S1_{Bino}} = (1-g1)\times g1\times n_\gamma
\label{eq:S1_bino} 
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\rm Var_{S1_{Bino}}$ is the binomial variance of the S1 light collection process with probability g1 and $\rm n_\gamma$ number of trials.

After the light collection process, each PE that was collected undergoes a second fluctuation due to the single PE resolution of the PMTs. The variance from PMT resolution can be written as
\begin{equation}
 \rm Var_{S1_{PMT}} = g_1\times n_\gamma \times \sigma_{PE}^2}
\label{eq:S1_pmt}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\rm Var_{S1_{PMT}}$ is the average variance of all PE collected. The average variance in the single PE size of all PMTs is $\rm \sigma_{PE}^2$ and is multiplied by the number of PE collected, $\rm g_1\times n_\gamma$. 


Combining the two linearly independent processes of equation \ref{eq:S1_bino} and \ref{eq:S1_pmt} leads to the the result in equation \ref{eq:Sig_S1}.
\begin{equation}
\rm  \sigma_{S1_{stat}}^2 = (1-g_1+\sigma_{PE}^2) (g_1 n_\gamma) = (1-g_1+\sigma_{PE}^2) S1 \\ 
\label{eq:Sig_S1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm \sigma_{S1_{stat}}^2 $ is the statistical variance of the S1 signal. We test equation \ref{eq:Sig_S1} using the 9.4 $\rm keV$ S1 signal from \KrCal. At that energy the dominant fluctuation is due the statistical variance of light collection, we can ignore contributions from recombination fluctuations and instrumental fluctuations (will be discussed later in this section).

The variance in the measured number of photons is then just {eq:Sig_S1} over $\rm g_1^2$, using equation \ref{eq:Sig1}.
\begin{equation}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}^2 = \frac{(1-g_1+\sigma_{PE}^2)n_\gamma}{g_1} \\ % change to sigma S1
\label{eq:Sig_Ng}
\end{equation}

% Show 9.4 keV here. And that it's sigma is within error of g1

%
%


The variance of the S2 signal, in equation \ref{eq:Sig2}, is also comprised of several independent processes. First, the S2 signal fluctuates due to the extraction efficiency of electrons from the liquid-gas interface. We define $\rm \epsilon$ as the extraction efficiency of the electrons, or the extraction probability of each electron from the liquid. The binomial variance of such a process, for extracting $\rm n_e \times SE_b$ each with probability $\rm epsilon$ multiplied by the amount of PE per extracted election, $\rm SE_b$.

$\rm Var_{n_e} = \frac{(1-ext)\times Ext\times n_e \times(single_E)}{g_2^2}$, Ext is the electron extraction probability and $\rm single_E$ is the single electron size in PE. Second, the variance in the response of the PMTs to a single electron. $\rm Var_{n_e} = \frac{Ext\times n_e \times \sigma_{SE}^2}{g_2^2}$. 

Finally, the additional variance from electron attenuation is modeled as a Poisson probability of electron capture in each Z slice of the detector. The variance from each Z slice depends of the average number of electrons that will be attenuated. The probability of attenuation at each slice in drift time T is $\rm P(T)= 1-e^{-T/\tau}$, where $\rm \tau$ for the data sets to be considered is 1000 $\rm \mu s$. The drift region considered in the fiducial volume is from 38 to 304.5 $\rm \mu s$. The average variance from events in the fiducial can be given by equation \ref{eq:Sig_Att}.

\begin{equation}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{e_{att}}}^2 = n_e \frac{\mathlarger{\int}\limits_{\mathsmaller{T_{min}}}^{\mathsmaller{T_{max}}} (1-e^{-T/\tau})\mathrm{d}T}{\mathlarger{\int}\limits_{\mathsmaller{T_{min}}}^{\mathsmaller{T_{max}}}\mathrm{d}T} = 0.155 \times n_e
\label{eq:Sig_Att}
\end{equation}

Combining the variances leads to the the result for the statistical variance in the observed number of electrons equation \ref{eq:Sig_S2}.

\begin{equation}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}}^2 = \frac{Ext \times \sigma_{SE}^2+(1-Ext)\times g2}{g_2^2} n_e +  \sigma_{n_{e_{att}}}^2\\
\label{eq:Sig_S2}
\end{equation}


For this analysis we use the following detector gains: \ref{eq:g1g2}. 
\begin{multline} \\
\rm g_1 = 0.097 \pm 0.008 \,[PE/n_\gamma]\\
\rm g_2=SE_{b} \times Ext = 5.75 \pm 1.4 \,[PE/n_e]\\
\rm SE_{b} = 9.70 \pm 0.05  \,[PE/n_e] \\\ 
\rm \sigma SE_b = 3.64\, [PE/n_e]\\
\rm Ext = 0.593\pm 0.144 \\
\rm \sigma_{PE} = 0.51\, [PE/n_\gamma]\\\
\label{eq:g1g2}
\end{multline}

Combining equations \ref{eq:Sig_S1}-\ref{eq:g1g2} we find the intrinsic detector resolution for the average S1 and S2 signals in the LUX detector, equation \ref{eq:SigStat}. Note, the intrinsic resolution in S2 is subdominant to that of S1, since  on average one electron multiplies to about ten photons detected by the bottom PMT array [ref]. Also listed in \ref{eq:SigInst}, are the instrumental fluctuations with a linear dependance on quanta measured with a global fit to mono energetic sources [next section]. The total variance in the light and charge channels is the linear combination of the statistical and instrumental variance.  

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}} = 3.46 \sqrt{n_\gamma}\\
\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}} = 0.68 \sqrt{n_e}
\label{eq:SigStat}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{inst}}} = \frac{6.4\pm 1.7}{100} \times n_\gamma\\
\rm  \sigma_{n_{e_{inst}}} = \frac{6.6\pm 0.9}{100} \times n_e
\label{eq:SigInst}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}^2 + \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{inst}}}^2 \\
\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}}^2 + \sigma_{n_{e_{inst}}}^2
\label{eq:SigDet}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


\section{Measuring Recombination Fluctuations with Mono-Energetic Sources}
\label{sec:flucs_mono}

To model recombination we start with the assumption that for a given energy deposit in liquid xenon the number of quanta produced is equal to the number of excitons and the number of ions. The number of ions cerated contains a spread given by a Fano factor F. The value of F for liquid xenon is small, has a theoretical value of 0.05 \cite{FanoTheoretical}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \frac{E}{W} = n_q = n_i + n_{ex}\\
\rm \frac{E}{W} = n_\gamma + n_e
\label{eq:Energy}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where E is energy in [keV], W is the work function in [keV/quanta], $\rm n_{q}$ is the number of quanta, $\rm n_{i}$ is the number of ions and $\rm n_{ex}$ is the number of excitons. The theoretical value of the number of excitons produced to ions is $\rm \frac{n_{ex}}{n_{i}}= \alpha = 0.20$ \cite{Doke_alpha} and is not expected to change vs. energy \cite{alpha_argon} \cite{alpha_xenon} \cite{Dahl_Thesis}. For the subsequent equations in this section we will simplify equations \ref{eq:Energy} to that in \ref{eq:Energy_2}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \alpha = 0.20\\
\rm  n_i = \frac{E}{W} \frac{1}{(1+\alpha)} =  \frac{n_\gamma + n_e}{(1+\alpha)}  \\ %  \frac{n_q}{(1+\alpha)}
\rm \sigma_{n_i}^2  = F \times n_i
\label{eq:Energy_2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:Energy_2} gives us a simple model for the number of ions and excitons produced for a given interaction, the only spread in quanta thus far is due to a Fano factor governing the spread in initial quanta produced. We now convert ions and excitons to scintillation and ionization signals that are measured in the LUX detector, S1  and S2 respectively. The number of photons observed for a given energy deposit arise from the excitons that de-excite and from ions which recombine with freed electrons. The number of electrons corresponding to a given energy deposit will be equal to the number of ions that did not recombine with a freed electron. 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  n_\gamma = n_{ex} + n_i\times r = n_i\times (r+\alpha) \\
\rm  n_e = n_i\times (1-r)\\
\rm r= \frac{\frac{n_\gamma}{n_e}-\alpha}{\frac{n_\gamma}{n_e} + 1}
\label{eq:Quanta}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where r represents the electron-ion recombination probability. A key measurable quantity is the size of recombination probability fluctuation $\rm \sigma_r$. Since we measure $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ as S1 and S2 signals and not ions and excitons, an additional variance arrises from the ion-electron recombination fluctuations. These recombination fluctuations are dependent on the dE/dx of each individual electron produced making them much larger than the spread from the Fano factor. We now combine the uncertainties from the Fano factor, recombination and the statistical uncertainty from detector resolution ($\rm\sigma_{Det}$) and solve for the observed quantities given in \ref{eq:SigR}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \sigma_{n_\gamma}^2  =\sigma_{n_{ex}}^2 + \sigma_{n_i}^2 r^2 +  \sigma_{r}^2 n_i^2 +\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2 + n_iF(r^2) + \sigma_{r}^2 n_i^2 + \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 \\
\rm \sigma_{n_e}^2  = \sigma_{n_i}^2 (1-r)^2 +  \sigma_{r}^2 n_i^2 +\sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2= n_iF(1-r)^2+ \sigma_{r}^2 n_i^2 +\sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2
\label{eq:SigR}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


For convenience we will work with $\rm n_i = (\rm n_\gamma + n_e)/(1+\alpha)$, this convention is chosen because both the Fano factor and recombination fluctuations act on number of ions and also because the number of ions are linearly related to the initial energy deposit. Using a mono energetic source and combined energy(equation \ref{eq:Energy}) we can measure $\rm \sigma_{n_\gamma}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{e}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{E}^2$. Dropping the contribution form the Fano factor and the the number of excitons it can be shown that the value recombination fluctuations $\rm \sigma R$ can be determined by rearranging equation \ref{eq:SigR}, keeping in ming that $\rm \sigma E$ contains no recombination fluctuations. Where $\rm \sigma R$ is in units of quanta, $\rm \sigma_R = n_i\sigma_r$.

\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{R}^2  = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma_{n_\gamma}^2 + \sigma_{n_e}^2 - \frac{\sigma_E^2}{W^2}\right)\\
\label{eq:Dahl}
\end{equation}

Where the spread in observed quanta $\rm \sigma_{n_\gamma}^2$ and $\sigma_{n_e}^2$ result from a linear combination of the variance from detector resolution and recombination fluctuations.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 + \sigma{R^2}\\
\rm \sigma_{n_{e}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 + \sigma{R^2}
\label{eq:SigQ}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

We do not directly observe the fluctuation in number of photons and electrons, instead we measure the fluctuations in the corresponding S1 and S2. The fluctuation in the S1 and S2 signal when divided by the gains g1 g2 represent on average the fluctuation in photons or electrons due to detector resolutions (statistical and instrumental variance) combined with recombination fluctuations. \ref{eq:SigQ}.

%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_{S1}^2}{g_1^2}\\
%\rm \sigma_{n_{e}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_{S2}^2}{g_2^2}
%\label{eq:Sig_Det}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_{S1}^2}{g_1^2} - \sigma{R^2}\\
\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_{S2}^2}{g_2^2} - \sigma{R^2}
\label{eq:SigQ_S1S2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Combining equations \ref{eq:Dahl} and \ref{eq:SigQ_S1S2} leads to the results in equation \ref{eq:Dahl_2}, which is a formula to directly measure recombination fluctuations using a mono energetic source.

\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{R}^2  = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\sigma_{S1}^2}{g_1^2} + \frac{\sigma_{S2}^2}{g_2^2} - \frac{\sigma_E^2}{W^2}\right)\\
\label{eq:Dahl_2}
\end{equation}

Equations \ref{eq:Dahl_2} and \ref{eq:SigQ_S1S2} gives us a method to measure recombination fluctuations along with fluctuations in $\rm n_\gamma$ and $\rm n_e$ due to intrinsic detector resolution, (will be discussed in the next section). It is important to note that $\rm \sigma_{n_\gamma}^2$, $\rm \sigma_{n_e}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{E}^2 $ are observable quantities when using a mono energetic source. The variance in combined energy does not contain variance from recombination fluctuations as those fluctuation occur along lines of constant energy. Note, we have dropped the contribution from the Fano factor and the spread is excitons as they are much smaller than recombination fluctuations or the variances from measuring light and charge intrinsic to the detector. The observed variance in the light and charge channels (S1, S2) is the result of two compounded random processes. After the initial charge deposit the number of charge and light quanta undergo recombination fluctuations. Subsequently, as the light or charge is collected in the detector an additional variance from detector resolution occurs. The result is the sum of two random processes thus the variance are added.


%\begin{equation}
%\rm \sigma_{R}^2  = \frac{1}{2}( \sigma_{R}^2 + \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}^2 + \sigma_{R}^2 + \sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}}^2 - (\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{stat}}}^2+\sigma_{n_{e_{stat}}}^2))
%\label{eq:Dahl_2}
%\end{equation}

%\subsection{Results with Mono Energetic Calibration Sources}

Using equation \ref{eq:Dahl_2} and \ref{eq:SigQ_S1S2} along with the measurements of g1 g2, we construct a combined energy and deconvolve the recombination fluctuations from variances in the light and charge channel of the detector. The result is shown in figure \ref{fig:E_dis}, the black white and red lines represent $\rm \sigma R, \, \sigma n_{\gamma_{Det}}, \,\sigma n_{e_{Det}}$, respectively for sources listed in Table \ref{table:Cal_lines}. A variance with a linear and root term is fit to the data and used to extract instrumental fluctuations and constrain the statistical fluctuations. The linear term corresponds to instrumental fluctuations and the root term corresponds to statistical fluctuations. Instrumental fluctuations go like the signal size and may potentially be due to ripples in the liquid surface caused by xenon bubbles or other systematics that are unaccounted for. The root term should result purely from counting photo electrons, described earlier. We find:


\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Stat}}}^2 + \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Inst}}}^2 =\left(0 \pm10\cdot \sqrt{n_\gamma}\right)^2 + \left((6.4\pm1.8)/100\cdot n_\gamma\right)^2 \\
\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{e_{Stat}}}^2 + \sigma_{n_{e_{Inst}}}^2 = \left(1\pm4\cdot \sqrt{n_e}\right)^2 + \left((6.6\pm0.6)/100\cdot n_e\right)^2 \\
\rm \sigma_R^2=   \left((5.5\pm0.5)/100\cdot n_q\right)^2
\label{eq:Inst_Fit}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\section{Measuring Recombination Fluctuations in Desecrate Energy Bins}
\label{sec:flucs_mono_bins}

The pervious subsection demonstrated the power of using a mono energetic source measure recombination fluctuations, equation  \ref{eq:Dahl}. In this section we present a method to decouple statistical variance from recombination fluctuations when confined to an energy bin of width $\rm \Delta_E$. The consideration of desecrate binning is crucial when dealing with a continual energy spectrum. Take the tritium beta spectrum as an example, we lose the ability to independently measure $\rm \sigma_{n_\gamma}^2$, $\rm \sigma_{n_e}^2$, $\rm \sigma_{E}^2 $ and are only left with a smear of $\rm n_\gamma$, $\rm n_e$, $\rm E $. However, there are two key pieces of information still left at our disposal. First, the combined energy can be reconstructed from global fits to g1 and g2, and even corrected for spectral shape and detector resolution (discussed later in section [link]). Second, we can calculate values of statistical variance for the light and charge channels as a function of energy, described in \ref{eq:SigStat},  \ref{eq:SigInst}. It will be shown in this section that having a priori knowledge of g1 and g2 and the functional for of the statistical variance from detector resolution will be sufficient to measure recombination fluctuations for a continual energy spectrum binned in energy with width $\rm \Delta_E$.


We begin the treatment of binning with the the case of having a finite bin width around the central combined energy of a mono energetic source. First, we quantify the change in the statistical components of equation \ref{eq:SigR} when slicing out a bin in combined energy space. The slice in combined energy is illustrated for a toy model at quanta corresponding to that of the combined 41.6 keV $\rm^{83}Kr$ decay in Figure \ref{fig:Recomb}. All contribution from recombination fluctuations are included when slicing out a section of combined energy, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Recomb}. However, the slice contains only a reduced statistical component from both the light and charge signals, and in the limit that $\rm \Delta E$ goes to zero the statistical component of light and charge converge to a value defined as $\rm \chi_{stat}$ (where $\rm \chi$ is the measured $\rm \sigma$ in a bin of combined energy). To solve for the value of  $\rm \chi_{stat}$ we first calculate the slope induced by statistical variance in the number of photons vs. quanta and the complementary slope of electrons vs. quanta, defined as M and 1-M respectively.  The value of M depends on the magnitude of the statistical variances and is given in equation \ref{eq:Angle}. The sum of the two slopes must equal one as the sum of photons and electors make up combined energy.


 \begin{figure}[h!]\centering

\caption{Top: Illustration of statistical variance, recombination fluctuations are set to 0. The spread in number of photons moves vertically and the spread in number of electrons moves horizontally. In black, a line of constant energy along the mean of combined energy with a width $\rm \Delta E$.

\label{fig:Recomb}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm M = tan(\theta_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}})=\frac{\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2}{\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2+ \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2} \\
\rm 1-M = tan(\theta_{n_{e_{Det}}})=\frac{\sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2}{\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2+ \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2} 
\label{eq:Angle}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


With the slope between combined energy and $\rm \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}$ and between energy and $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}$ defined in equation \ref{eq:Angle} the value of the shared statistical uncertainty in combined energy space can be determined. We first treat the case of $\rm \Delta E$ = 0 in equation \ref{eq:SigCE} which is also valid when the centroid of light yield and change yield has been subtracted (discussed later).

\begin{equation}
\rm \chi_{Det}^2= M^2\sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 + (1-M)^2\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2
\label{eq:SigCE}
\end{equation}


The variable $\rm \chi$ is used to represent the observed $\rm \sigma$ when dealing in bins of combined energy. Let's briefly consider the implication of equation \ref{eq:SigCE}. For the case of $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 = \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2$, M=0.5, resulting in $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2=\sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2= \chi_{Det}^2$. This case can be thought of as sweeping out equal variance from the statistical population which would for a circle as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Recomb}. For the case of $\rm \sigma_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2 \neq \sigma_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2$ the observed statistical variance in a slice of combined energy will become less than the variance of the best channel. Specifically for the LUX detector the implication of equation \ref{eq:SigCE} is that the statistical variance measured in a slice of combined energy will collapse to less than that of the S2 statistical uncertainty, as bin width $\rm \Delta_E$ goes to zero.


To complete the treatment of binned energy in this section we now add the final piece to the observed statistical variance, the contribution from the bin width $\rm \Delta_E$. The residual variance arrises from rotating the population of 2D gaussian about the bin center, the rotation having a slope of M or (1-M) as given in equation \ref{eq:Angle}. Note, the residual term from the slope can also be removed by centroid subtraction of the photons and electrons vs. energy as discussed later in section \ref{sec:Centroid}, in that case we are only left with $\chi_{Det}^2$ shared between the two channels.


\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2= \chi_{Det}^2 + \frac{(MW\Delta_E)^2}{12}\\
\rm \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2= \chi_{Det}^2 + \frac{((1-M)W\Delta_E)^2}{12}\\
\label{eq:SigCE_2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}



Were $\chi^2$ is defined in \ref{eq:SigCE}, M is given in equation \ref{eq:Angle}, W is the work function in [quanta/keV], $\rm \Delta_E$ is a bin of energy [keV], the normalization of 12 arrises from the second moment of a rotated line about its center. The total observed variance, $\rm \chi^2$, in the number of photons and electrons considering a bin of combined energy can now be determined transforming equation \ref{eq:SigR} to \ref{eq:Sig_total_CE}.

%%.... this equation holds for the standard deviation of a uniform distribution
 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \chi_{n_\gamma}^2 = \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2 + n_iF(r)^2 + \sigma_{r}^2 n_i^2 + \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2 \\
\rm \chi_{n_e}^2  = n_iF(1-r)^2 + \sigma_{r}^2 n_i^2 + \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2
\label{eq:Sig_total_CE}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


In equation \ref{eq:Sig_total_CE} we have defined the observed standard deviation in units of quanta $\rm \chi$ for $\rm n_\gamma, n_e$ when working with bins of combined energy. In the limit that F, $\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2$ and $\rm \Delta_E$ go to zero the observed variance in number of photons and electrons ($\rm \chi_{n_\gamma}$ and $\rm \chi_{n_e}$) are related to the size of recombination fluctuations in a given combined energy bin, equation \ref{eq:SigR_CE_lim}. Where $\rm \sigma R$ is in units of quanta, $\rm \sigma_R = n_i\sigma_r$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 = \chi_{n_\gamma}^2 - \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2  \\
\rm \sigma_{R_e}^2 = \chi_{n_e}^2 - \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2
\label{eq:SigR_CE_lim}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

We have arrived at the conclusion of this section, armed with equation \ref{eq:SigR_CE_lim} we now have two methods for determining the size of recombination fluctuations, $\rm\sigma_{R}^2$ where the subscript $\rm \gamma$ or e is used to represent the channel of quanta used for the calculation. Either the observed variance in the light and charge channel can be used to measure the size of recombination fluctuation in a bin of energy. Any asymmetry between the two methods has implications which are discussed in the following subsection.


\subsection{Measuring the Fano Factor in Bins of Energy}

There are three terms in equation \ref{eq:Sig_total_CE} that give rise to an asymmetry between the observed variance $\rm \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2$  and  $\rm \sigma_{R_e}^2$. The small difference in variance from the slope can be solved for exactly leaving just the Fano factor F and $\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2$. By taking the difference of variance in the two channels component of recombination variance drops out leaving only the Fano factor and the variance in number of excitons, given in equation \ref{eq:Sig_total_CE}.

\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 - \sigma_{R_e}^2 = \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2 + n_iF(2r-1) 
\label{eq:Diff_X}
\end{equation}

F is the Fano factor, equation \ref{eq:Energy_2}, $\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2$ is the variance of the number of excitons produced and r is the recombination fraction, equation \ref{eq:Quanta}. %The value of $\delta_{Det}$ is the small residual depending on the bin width $\rm \Delta_E$, equation \ref{eq:Residual_Stat}.
%\begin{equation}
%\rm \delta_{Det}= \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 - \sigma_{R_e}^2 = \frac{(1-2M)(W\Delta_E)^2}{12}\\
%\label{eq:Residual_Stat}
%\end{equation}
Consider the case such that variance in the number of excitons $\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2$ is much less than the contribution from the Fano factor. In such a regime we can solve for the Fano factor, potentially energy dependent, from equations \ref{eq:Diff_X}.

\begin{equation}
\rm F(E)=\frac{\sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 - \sigma_{R_e}^2}{n_i(2r-1)}
\begin{cases} \rm r \neq \frac{1}{2}\\
\end{cases}
\label{eq:Fano}
\end{equation}

There is an underlying subtlety to equation \ref{eq:Fano}. Remarkably, in the limit that $\rm \Delta_E$ goes to zero the Fano factor can be extracted with minimal knowledge of intrinsic detector statistical variance. Further, when the statistical variance of S1 and S2 are identical the value of M (equation \ref{eq:Residual_Stat}) will be 0.5. In that special case no knowledge of the statistical variance is needed to measure the Fano factor. 


When $ \rm r = \frac{1}{2}$ the coefficient in front of the Fano factor becomes zero in equation \ref{eq:Diff_X}. At this value an equal contribution from the Fano factor goes into the variance $\rm \chi^2$ of photons and electrons, allowing for the smaller value of $\rm \sigma_{ex}^2$ to be extracted. 

\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2=\sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 - \sigma_{R_e}^2
\begin{cases} \rm r= \frac{1}{2} || \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2 > > n_iF(2r-1)\\
\end{cases}
\label{eq:SigmaEx}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:SigmaEx} is also valid in the case that $\rm \sigma_{n_{ex}}^2$ is much larger than the contribution form the Fano factor. This happens to be true when dealing with the time dependent light yield of $\rm ^{83m}Kr$, this topic will be explored in the next section.




\subsection{Application to $\rm^{83}Kr$}

Using the high stats Kr83 calibration data we can validate the method for working in a bin of energy since the exact solution for recombination and detector fluctuations can be measured, as outlined in section \ref{sec:flucs_mono} and \ref{sec:flucs_mono_bins}. Once the fluctuations from detector resolution are measured in the light and charge channel (S1 and S2 signals), the asymmetry between the two channels can be used to calculate the Fano factor (equation \ref{eq:Sig_total_CE} ). The asymmetry in fluctuations in the light and charge channel arrises from the Fano factor acting on ion production which is later amplified through the recombination fraction, as long as the recombination fraction does not equal 0.5. For the case of the $\rm ^{83m}Kr$ calibration the recombination fraction was 0.772 resulting in recombination fluctuations of 3 to 4 more quanta in the light channel as compared to the charge channel, see table \ref{table:R_Kr}. Though the additional recombination fluctuation is small having ample statistics the Fano factor can be constrained. 
The errors in the measurement were derived from simulated Kr data sets of 400,000 events with the Fano factor turned off, using 100 trials. First, recombination fluctuations were turned off and only fluctuations from detector resolution as calculated in section \ref{sec:flucs_mono} were used, see Table \ref{table:Simulated_Sigmas_R_0}. It was found that the error of the difference in recombination fluctuation from the light and charge channel ($\rm sigma_{R_{\gamma}}^2$ and $\sigma_{R_{e}}^2 $) along with the error in ion production and recombination fraction were enough to constrain the Fano factor to 0.001-0.003. Next, the value of recombination was set slightly higher than the actual value of 82 to 100 quanta and the trials were repeated, see table \ref{table:Simulated_Sigmas_R_100}. With the addition of recombination fluctuations to detector resolution fluctuations the error on measuring the Fano factor grew to 0.002-0.009, with smaller bin sizes ($\rm\Delta E$ around the center leading to the smallest error as seen from equation \ref{eq:SigCE_2}.

The results of the high stats calibration data are shown in table \ref{table:R_Kr}, containing 400k events in the fiducial volume of the detector. Using equation \ref{eq:SigR_CE_lim} we find good agreement between the method described in equation \ref{eq:Dahl} and the recombination fluctuation calculated from the charge channel ($\rm \sigma_{R_\gamma}$ and $\rm \sigma_{R_e}$).  The accuracy helps us build confidence that the statistical components of the detector are modeled well enough to measure recombination fluctuation to within 3\%. Further, the ability to see the asymmetry in recombination fluctuations between the light and charge channel demonstrates the power of using binned combined energy (section \ref{sec:flucs_mono_bins}). Any observed difference between the two channels  can only be from either the Fano factor or spread in exiton production, but we assume the fluctuations in exiton production are much less than fluctuations in ion production. The Fano factor is derived from equations \ref{eq:Fano} and the uncertainty was determined from simulations. The total fluctuation as number of quanta is listed in the rightmost column. The Fano factor manifests itself as an asymmetry between fluctuations in the light and charge channel as given in equation \ref{eq:Sig_total_CE}, the recombination fraction was found to be r= 0.772 and the average number of ions produced per decay was $\rm n_i=2900$. 
Having demonstrated the method for a mono energetic calibration source the next step will be to apply the method on the continuous beta spectrum of the tritium data.

\subsection{Application to Simulated Tritium Data (any continuous spectrum)}

%ref Partrick
%This will be demonstrated later (or maybe show it in the simulation)
Adapting the equation of the previous section to continuous energy spectra requires that the centriod of a continue spectrum be subtracted off so that the variance from the light yield or charge yield vs. energy is removed. After applying the Smearing Model of Section 4 we apply the method described in this section to extract recombination fluctuations form the tritium data.

In this subsection we test method outlined in section \ref{sec:flucs_mono_bins} for dealing in bins of combined energy specifically applied to the tritium beta spectrum, but the method outlined can be used for any continue spectrum. To first order the treatment of the continuous spectrum is identical to that outlined for the mono energetic source as outlined previously in subsection \ref{sec:flucs_mono_bins}. Figure \ref{fig:T_Stat} illustrates a tritium beta spectrum convolved with detector resolution similar to that measured for the LUX detector, the figure is analogous to Figure \ref{fig:Recomb}. As the bin size around a value of combined energy is squeezed to zero the statistical variance in the number of photons and electrons converge, the value is given by equation \ref{eq:SigCE_2}. Whereas, regardless of bin size recombination fluctuations remain since they move along lines of constant energy. In order to adapt the methodology developed for a mono energetic source to a continuous energy spectra requires that the centriod of the light and charge yield be subtracted off. The slope in the light and charge channels from the fundamental yield  induce a further variance on top of $\rm \chi_{Det}$ from the population in an energy bin being tilted as demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:SIM_LYQY}. For the purposes of this study, we find it sufficient to fit a quadratic form to the centroid of the entire population and subtract off the local slope from the measured variance. An analogous methods for centriod subtraction to extract recombination fluctuations are described in detail in [Patrick's Thesis].

%Add centriod subtracted equation. Explain that even if S1, S2 Det are off we can do as good as the best channel (S2) due to X_Det. As long as SigR is greater, since they add in quadrature.


\subsection{Centriod Subtraction}
\label{sec:Centroid}
For the case of a continuous source we expand upon the result from section \ref{sec:flucs_mono_bins} where the additional variance from detector resolution was calculated per energy bin as $\rm \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2$ and $\rm \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2$. When dealing with a continuous source we must subtract off the centroid of the number of photons and electron vs. energy to remove additional variance induced by the slope. What results is a common variance from detector resolution shared by both the charge and light channel in each bin of energy, defined as $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ = $\rm \chi_{n_{\gamma_{Det}}}^2$ = $\rm \chi_{n_{e_{Det}}}^2$, equation \ref{eq:SigR_Cent}. The value of $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ is derived in \ref{eq:Centroid} for a small variation in $\rm n_e$ around combined energy, and is identical to that found for the case of the mono energetic source in equation \ref{eq:SigCE}. This is analogous to saying that the centroid subtraction is removing the additional variance from the slope of light field and charge yield. The local slope of  $\rm n_e$ with respect to quanta ($\rm n_\gamma + n_e$) is (1-M), given in \ref{eq:Angle}. 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method we use the measured detector resolution along with a test recombination fluctuation and simulate a tritium spectrum. The result of extracting recombination is shown in figure \ref{fig:T_Var} for various energy bin widths. As long as the recombination is greater than $\rm \chi_{Det}$, which is being added in quadrature, the value of recombination can be determined to good precision using the method. The small deviation around the first and last bins is due to the spectral shape, a correction for spectral shape will be discussed in the next section and will improve the measurement of $\rm \sigma_R$. The analytic solution for extracting recombination given in equation \ref{eq:SigR_Cent} is sufficient to first order, we ignore second order corrections in this analysis. After correcting observables for the tritium beta spectral shape we will be ready to use the tools of this section to decouple detector resolution and measure recombination fluctuations from the tritium data

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 = \chi_{n_\gamma}^2 - \chi_{Det}^2  \\
\rm \sigma_{R_e}^2 = \chi_{n_e}^2 - \chi_{Det}^2 \\

\section{Extracting Recombination Fluctuations from Tritium Calibration Data}
\label{sec:Recomb_Data}

In this section we apply the methods outlined in this chapter and use them to extract the recombination fluctuations vs. energy from the tritium data. The first step in this process was calibrate the energy scale solving for g1 and g2 as outlined in \ref{Ch:E_Scale_Cal}. Second, the S1 and S2 signals of the tritium calibration data were corrected for spectral shape as outlined previously in section \ref{sec:Smear} and discussed in more detail in \ref{Ch:LYQY}. Finally, having modeled and measured the statistical and instrumented variances for light collection of the LUX detector \ref{eq:SigDet} \ref{eq:SigStat} \ref{eq:SigInst} the component of detector resolution in each energy bin can be calculated $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ \ref{eq:SigCE}, ref{eq:Angle}, {eq:Centroid}. For the remained of the thesis we will work in centroid subtracted space as detailed in equation {eq:Centroid}, the results are identical to working in non centroid subtracted space using a bin width correction of equation \ref{eq:SigR_CE_lim}, which is the equivalent of making a linear approximation to the local slope.  


Since the tritium beta spectrum is continuous the calibration data is divided into energy bins. In each energy bin the mean of S1 and $\rm S2_b$ is measured and converted to the mean number of photons and electrons using g1 and g2. Once that is known the variance from detector resolution in each bin can be determined, defined as $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ \ref{eq:Centroid}, \ref{eq:SigCE}. We then measure the variance of both the fluctuations in the photon and electron channels using Gaussian fits to the distributions in each energy bin, defined as $\rm \chi^2$. The recombination variance and variance from detector resolution are two independent processes making the observed variance in each bin $\rm \chi^2$ a sum of $\rm \chi_{Det}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_R^2$. We measure the variance of both the light and channel $\rm \chi_{\gamma}^2$ and $\rm \chi_e^2$ and solve for $\rm \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2$ and $\rm \sigma_{R_e}^2$ where the subscripts $\rm \gamma$ and e denote the photon and electron channel respectively. Using this we find
\begin{equation}
\rm \sigma_R^2 = \sigma_{R_\gamma}^2 = \sigma_{R_e}^2 = \chi^2-\chi_{Det}^2
\end{equation}
\noindent the same result as outlined in \ref{eq:SigR_Cent}. The recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma R$ can be extracted from the tritium calibration data. The result of the tritium calibration is shown in figure \ref{fig:R_Flucs_Quanta} for both the 170 V/cm and 100 V/cm data. The 170 V/cm data had 140,000 tritium beta decays in the fiducial volume and the 100 V/cm data contained 4,500 events.

The figures on the left in \ref{fig:R_Flucs_Quanta} (a: 170 V/cm, c: 100 V/cm)  show the extracted recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma_R$ from the light (black) and change (red) channel denoted with subscript $\gamma$ and e respectively, note they are identical. Also shown are the fluctuations in light collection $\rm \chi_{\gamma_{Det}}^2$ (blue), charge collection $\rm \chi_{e_{Det}}^2$ (cyan), and their manifestation as detector resolution in a combined energy bin as $\rm \chi_{Det}$ (magenta). The detector resolution is actually slightly better than the resolution of the best channel, for the case of LUX is the charge collection. The remaining fluctuations in the light and charge channel after subtracting off the detector resolution in quadrature are shown in black and red, respectively. In regions where the measured recombinations are larger than the fluctuations caused by detector resolution any error in quanta counting from uncertainty on g1 and g2 is negligible as the signals add in quadrature. At the higher energy bins the uncertainty grows as the result becomes statistics limited.

Since the detector resolution $\rm \chi_{Det}$ is solved for in terms of photons and electrons the means of the of number of photons and electrons in each energy bin must be measured first.


\subsection{Extracting Recombination fraction From Tritium Data}

Having measured the mean number of photons and electrons in each bin the value of recombination probability r can be determined using equation \ref{eq:Quanta}. Figure \ref{fig:R_T} shows the measurement of recombination probability r for the 170 V/cm and 100 V/cm tritium calibration data. The shaded region represents the one sigma of the recombination probability which can be thought of in terms of the recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma_r = \sigma_R / n_{ions} $. Note, the bands converge below 4 $\rm keV_{ee}$ meaning that the light yields and charge yields also converge (discussed in ch 6), this leads to the energy thresholds at 1.5 keV being identical for at the two fields as seen in \ref{Ch:E_Scale_Cal}. Further, the ER and NR discrimination in this region overlap as will be discussed in the next subsection. All this translates into no observed improvement in either energy threshold or background rejection from 1 to 4 $\rm keV_{ee}$ between using a 100 and 170 V/cm field.

\label{fig:R_T}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Modeling the ER Band}

The main purpose of this section, and the tritium calibrations, are to be able to make predictions about WIMP sensitivity at various electric fields and in the WIMP search energies of interest, 1-5 $\rm keV_{ee}$. We now have the ability to reconstruct the electronic recoil band as it would appear with infinite detector resolution, with the ability to expand the band width by adding the measured detector resolution. Knowing the mean and width of the electronic recoil band and the mean of the NR band (described later) we can make predictions for ER and NR type discrimination which is a proxy for background event rejection.  

The mean of the ER band in discrimination space can be written as
\begin{equation}
\rm log_{10}(S2_b/S1) = log_{10} \left(\frac{(1-r)N_i}{(r+\alpha)N_i}\right) + log_{10}\left(\frac{g2}{g1}\right)
\label{eq:Band_Mean}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the observed charge and light signals $\rm S2_b$ and S1 have been converted to recombination probability r,  number of ions $\rm N_i$ and the exciton to ion ratio $\rm \alpha$ using equations \ref{eq:Gain} and \ref{eq:Quanta}.

The variance of the band can be written as,
\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{log_{10}(S2_b/S1)} = \frac{1}{\left(log(10)\right)^2} \times \sigma_R^2 \left( \frac{ - (\alpha+1) }{(1-r)(r+\alpha)N_i} \right)^2
\label{eq:Band_Var}
\end{equation}

\noindent Which has been written in terms of the number of ions $\rm N_i$, the recombination fraction r, and the measured recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma_R$, defined to be $\rm \sigma_r\times N_i$. The result of the ER band's mean population and its corresponding 1 sigma fluctuation are shows in figure \ref{fig:ER_Band_Calc} for the case of 100 V/cm (blue) and 170 V/cm (black). This result shows the ER band with recombination fluctuations only. One can add light and charge collection fluctuations in quadrature to complete the modeling specific to any detector. Above 4 $\rm keV_{ee}$ the band separate as the higher drift field increased the charge extraction leading to better discrimination.

Above 4 $\rm keV_{ee}$ the band separate as the higher drift field increased the charge extraction leading to better discrimination.}

\subsection{Measuring Alpha From the Tritium Data}

Having measured r and $\rm \sigma_r$ from the tritium calibration data the constancy of the exciton to ion ratio $\rm \alpha$ can be checked by requiring that as the number of ions tends to one the recombination fluctuations tend to that of a binomial process. This is justified as a single ion-electron pair will either recombine or not with some recombination probability r having a binomial variance written as,
\begin{equation}
\rm BinoVar= (1-r)rN_i
\label{eq:Bino_Var}
\end{equation}

\noindent where r is the recombination probability and $\rm N_i$ is the number of ions which can be thought of as the number of trials for the binomial process. In figure \ref{fig:Alpha_T} the y axis shows the ratio of the measured standard deviation of recombination to the standard deviation of a purely binomial process. The figure on the right has the expected binomial standard deviation on the x axis. The best alpha is one in which the observed standard deviation converges with that of a binomial process as the binomial variance tends to 1. The figure on the left has the number of ions available for recombination on the x axis. As the number of ions approaches one the standard deviation of recombination should become that of a binomial process. A single ion will either recombine or not with probability r.  The extrapolation is made by fitting the lowest energy bins above 90\% threshold 1.3 to 3 keV. Going below the value of one on the y axis implies that recombining electron-ion pairs have a variance better than binomial, which is unphysical if it is a random process.We find that the best intercept converging to a purely binomial process is with $\alpha$ = 0.20 consistent with the measurement in \cite{Doke_alpha} and not 0.06 as used in \cite{Dahl_Thesis}.

\section{Extracting Recombination Fluctuations from $\rm ^{137}Cs$ Calibration}

To expand the picture of recombination fluctuation to higher energies the same method used for the tritium calibration was applied to the Compton edge of a $\rm ^{137}Cs$ external calibration source. The $\rm ^{137}Cs$ source provides ER calibration data from the backscatter peak around 150 keV to the photo peak at 662 keV. Figure \ref{fig:Cs_LYQYR} on the left shows the measured mean number of photons, electron in each energy bin along with their one sigma fluctuation (shaded). The number of excitons and ions are also show assuming an $\alpha$ = 0.20. Once the mean number of photons and electrons are measured the recombination probability is determined and plotted on the right in figure \ref{fig:Cs_LYQYR}. The inflection around 662 keV is due to the sharp rise and fall of the photo peak skewing the measurement of number of photons and electrons.

\section{Recombination Fluctuations, The Bigger Picture}
We have now measured the recombination probability and fluctuation over a wide range of energies and at two fields for tritium (100 and 170 V/cm). The calibrations range from the 1.0 keV 50\% threshold with tritium to about 700 keV with the $\rm^{137}Cs$ calibration, and include the line sources used for the energy calibration in \ref{Ch:E_Scale_Cal} and table \ref{table:Cal_lines}. Also shown is a $\rm ^{57}Co$ calibration at a variety of electric fields ranging from 60 to 5000 V/cm from \cite{Dahl_Thesis}. Figure \ref{fig:R_Big} on the left shows the observed recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma_R$ measurements vs. the standard deviation expected from a purely binomial process (equation \ref{eq:Bino_Var}). At our field of 100 and 170 V/cm we find good agreement with a simple power law fit which can be thought of as the fluctuation receiving an amplification over the underlying binomial process.

 Figure \ref{fig:R_Big} on the right shows the measured recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma_R$ vs. the number of ions available for recombination $\rm N_i$. The x axis is chosen to be number of ions as recombination fluctuations only act on ions and not excitons, the conversion to energy on the x axis is simply $\rm E = W\times n_i (1 + \alpha ) $. It is found that the measured recombination fluctuation can be well described by a generic power law fit.

There is no physical justification for the power law fit in figure \ref{fig:R_Big} to the apparent binomial variance amplification. This is a fatal flaw in our recombination model. The observed variance is off by roughly a factor of $\rm N_{ions}$, surpassing 1000 in the cesium data. The recombination model we are using assumes that every electron ions pair is a separate entity that either recombines or not, thus the variance should be binomial. There is another issue with the recombination model. The decline of recombination probability as the energy (or $\rm N_i$) tends to zero is unphysical yet is observed in the data, shown in figure \ref{fig:R_T}. The probability of the electron ion-pair to recombine should be insensitive to the number of electron-ion pairs created by the energy deposit. We take this as a first clue to solving the problem and outline the consequences of allowing for electron-ion pair mixing with some encounter probability in the next two sub-sections. Culminating with a model which will simultaneously reproduce the observed recombination fraction, explain its decline at low energy, and yield the correct recombination fluctuations.

\newpage 

\subsection{Encounter Recombination Probability}

The apparent amplification of the observed ER fluctuations over that of a binomial process is troubling. What causes the ER events to be so erratic over their nuclear recoil counterparts which can be well described by binomial fluctuation \cite{Dahl_Thesis}. The key difference that lends a clue to solving the puzzle is that for a given energy nuclear recoils will produce significantly less election-ion pairs. It has been observed for ER events that as the number of ions goes to one the recombination fluctuations do indeed become more binomial like, shown in figure \ref{fig:Alpha_T}. Before we move on, it should be noted that the method outlined in this section will succeed in explaining recombination fluctuation but will fail to reproduce the recombination fraction probability. This subsection is meant as a discussion on encounter recombination probability leading to the model in the subsection to follow that will bridge measuring recombination probability and its variance.

In order to tackle the issue of recombination fluctuations we introduce encounter recombination probably $\rm r_\epsilon$. The term $\rm r_\epsilon$ will couple freed electrons to ions other than its own. There are well motivated arguments to be made to include a $\rm r_\epsilon$ term. First, in liquid xenon the decay of the calibration source \KrCal has been observed to receive an enhancement of several percent in the light yield of the second 9.4 keV following the first decay of 32.1 keV \cite{Start_Kr}. This can be attributed to the second decay occurring surrounded by a ball of charge from the first decay resulting in an enhanced encounter recombination probability and increased light yield. The two \KrCal decays are separated by a half life to 154 ns \cite{83Kr_HalfLife_1}. The shorter the timing separation between the two decays the greater the light yield enhancement, with light yield enhancement observed past 1000 ns \cite{Kastens}, \cite{Baudis} [LUX data shows enhancement out to 2000 ns could add this plot to thesis...]. This lends evidence that freed electrons can be attracted to ions while diffusing from the interaction site on the time scales of hundreds of nano seconds. Further, the idea of encounter probability was worked out by Mozumder noting the need for encounter recombination probabilities of 0.01 in order to explain the ion production rate in liquid xenon \cite{Mozumder}. 

In this subsection we set out to model the variations resulting from the recombination porbability containing a component from encounter recombination probability. Once the model for variance is worked out we can fit to the tritium and $\rm^{137}Cs$ calibration data in order to extract the encounter recombination probability. 

First we start with expression for the variance of a binomial process with some recombination probability r. 

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_r= (1-r)rN_i
\label{eq:Bino_Var2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm N_i$ is the number of ions, and can be thought of as the number of trials. Next we split the total observed recombination probability into two components.

\begin{equation}
\rm r=r_s + r_\epsilon
\label{eq:rs}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm r_s$ is the self recombination probability and $\rm r_\epsilon$ is the encounter recombination probability. The expectation is that  $\rm r_\epsilon << r_s$, \cite{Mozumder}. The variance resulting from the two terms can be considered as independent processes occurring subsequently thus, the total variance of the process is the the sum of the individual variances for each ion. In our modeling every free electron has an average encounter probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ with each ion. The variance of $\rm N_i$ ions is given in equation \ref{eq:Bino_Var2} and is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Fig} for the case of one ion. At this point we pause to point out the fatal fall in this theory. As the number of ion-electron pairs grow all ions will recombine as each ion is unable to avoid recombination from the bombardment of $\rm N_i$ electrons. The observed recombination probability for this process becomes $\rm r=r_s + N_i\cdot r_\epsilon$. With that note, we proceed to learn more about encounter recombination probability.

\caption{Illustration of recombination for the case of a in single ion, blue box highlighted in black at the center. The total recombination probability for one ion is the combination of the the dominant self recombination probability ($\rm r_s$) plus the sum of the encounter recombination probabilities ($\rm r_\epsilon$) from the remaining N-1 electrons. This process is repeated for N number of ion electron pairs leading to a binomial variance given in equation \ref{eq:Var_s}. }
\label{fig:Flucs_Fig}
\end{figure}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{2}
\small\normalsize


\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{(r_s + r_\epsilon)} = \sum\limits_{N_i}r_s(1-r_s) + \sum\limits_{N_i} r_\epsilon(1-r_\epsilon)(N_i-1)
\label{eq:Var_s}
\end{equation}

\noindent the first term of equation \ref{eq:Var_s} is the binomial variance of a single electron-ion pair with some probability $\rm r_s$ to recombine. The second term is the binomial variance of the average encounter probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ with all other electrons excluding its own escaped electron, a total of ($\rm N_i$-1). Both terms are summed over all possible ions, accounting for all $\rm N_i$ ions with $\rm N_i -1$ electrons available to be encountered. Due to the relatively slow mobility of ions vs electrons, the ions are treated as fixed with the freed electrons having some probability of encounter an ion. This is a simplistic model that treats the encounter probability as an overall average for all electron-ion pair combinations. Assuming $\rm N_i$ is large equation \ref{eq:Var_s} can be simplified to 

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{(r_s + r_\epsilon)} = r_s(1-r_s)N_i + r_\epsilon(1-r_\epsilon)N_i^2
\label{eq:Var_s2}
\end{equation}

The result of splitting the recombination probability into self and encounter recombination is subtle, yet has huge implications. Comparing equation \ref{eq:Bino_Var2} to \ref{eq:Var_s} we find that the binomial variance of the process with encounter recombination probability will grow like $\rm N_i^2$ as opposed to the binomial variance of a self recombination process that grows like $\rm N_i$. To better understand the amplification of the binomial fluctuation observed in the data, figure \ref{fig:R_Big}, we define an amplification term as the ratio of the binomial variance with encounter recombination probability to that of a binomial process with self recombination probability r.

\begin{equation}
\rm \mathcal{A}= \frac{Var_{(r_s + r_\epsilon)}}{Var_r}
\label{eq:Amp}
\end{equation}

\noindent $\rm Var_{(r_s + r_\epsilon)}$ and $\rm Var_r$ are given in equations \ref{eq:Var_s2} and \ref{eq:Bino_Var2}, respectively. 


We will treat two cases. First, we will assume that $\rm r_\epsilon << r_s$ and $\rm r_s \simeq r$. Second, we will hold the ratio of $\rm r_\epsilon/r$ to be a constant. The second case is motivated by the idea that electric field and energy dependance that governs self recombination probability also applies to encounter recombination probability.

The amplification of the binomial variance from equation \ref{eq:Amp} is

\begin{equation}
\rm \mathcal{A} =\frac{N_i}{N_i} \left( \frac{ r_s(1-r_s) + r_\epsilon(1-r_\epsilon)N_i }{ r(1-r) } \right)
\label{eq:Amp_S1}
\end{equation}

\noindent assuming that $\rm r_\epsilon << r_s$ and $\rm r_s \simeq r$ equation \ref{eq:Amp_S1} can be simplified to, 

\begin{equation}
\rm \mathcal{A} =\left(1 +  \frac{ r_\epsilon(1-r_\epsilon)N_i }{ r(1-r) } \right)
\label{eq:Amp_S2}
\end{equation}
 
\noindent  Using equation \ref{eq:Amp_S2} the value of encounter recombination probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ can be extracted from the tritium and $\rm^{137}Cs$ data using $\rm N_i$, r, and $\rm \mathcal{A}$.  Where the value of binomial amplification $\rm \mathcal{A}$ is the extracted from the data defined as the recombination fluctuation $\rm \sigma R$ over $\rm \sigma R$-binomial, shown in figure \ref{fig:R_Big}. The result of extracting encounter recombination probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ is shown in figure \ref{fig:Encounter_R_Const}. The overall average of  $\rm r_\epsilon$ from the calibration data is $\rm r_\epsilon$ = 0.0042 varying from 0.002 to 0.007, in good agreement with Mozumder \cite{Mozumder}.

\newpage

Taking the value of $\rm r_\epsilon$ as a constant of 0.0042 we find that the observed ER recombination fluctuations are infact consistent with binomial fluctuation at our field of 170 and 100 V/cm, shown later in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Model}. This is a step in the right direction for understanding recombination fluctuations. Our data is limited to only two electric fields at 100 and 170 V/cm making it difficult to model field dependance. To expand the model we include data from Dahl, using a $\rm ^{57}Co$ source with fields ranging from 60 to 5000 V/cm \cite{Dahl_Thesis}. We then extract $\rm r_\epsilon$, shown as the black points in figure \ref{fig:Encounter_R_All}.

The data from Dahl, shown in \ref{fig:Encounter_R_All}, provides good motivation to proceed with our second assumption, modeling the ratio of $\rm r_\epsilon/r$ to be a constant. There appears to be correlation between the recombination probability and the encounter recombination probability. This correlation is sensible, considering that as the electric field is increased the freed electrons can escape the ions more readily. Thus, both the self and encounter recombination decline as a function of applied electron field. However, the assumption that $\rm r_\epsilon$ and r are always correlated is to be taken with a grain of salt, and is not supported by the tritium data. Between 2.5 and 10 keV the recombination probability r and $\rm r_\epsilon$ become anti-correlated. With that caveat mentioned, we proceed with the second case.

\begin{equation}
\rm r_\epsilon = r_{\epsilon_0} + \mathcal{C} r
\label{eq:Case_2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm \mathcal{C}$ is a constant linking the observed recombination probability r to $\rm r_\epsilon$. The best fit for both cases is show in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Model}. Case one, is with a global average of $\rm r_\epsilon$= 0.0042, extracted from the tritium and $\rm^{137}Cs$ data. Case two, is using $\rm r_\epsilon$ = 0.0011 + 0.006r. The fit for case one is within 30\% when excluding the data from Dahl, and the fit the second case deviates less than 30\% from all of the data.

The simplistic model outlined in this subsection demonstrates that recombination fluctuation of electronic recoil can indeed be the result of binomial statistics. Remarkably, a sub 1\% component of recombination probability r from encounter probability leads to an apparent binomial amplification factor of 1 to 1000, shown in the right plot in figure \ref{fig:R_Big}. The tiny value of $\rm r_\epsilon$ makes a significant impact when considering the combinatorics of the recombination process. This is good progress, we have found a simplistic was to gain an additional factor of $\rm N_i$ for recombination fluctuations vs. energy, instead of applying a power law fit to binomial amplification with no physical basis. However, we still need to clean up the problem of total ion-electron pair recombination resulting from such a model. We have found the correct variance but have failed to produced the correct recombination probability. The fix the the issue is described in the next subsection.


\subsection{Clusters of Encounter Recombination}

In the previous subsection a model was introduced which could predict the observed recombination fluctuations of ER events. However, the model failed to produce the correct recombination probability. We found that as the energy (or $\rm N_i$) rises the recombination probability tends to 1, and beyond as $\rm r=r_s + N_i\cdot r_\epsilon$. The zeroth order correction to this problem is to remove the self recombination term $\rm r_s$ and treat self recombination as just another encounter recombination probability, $\rm r_s=r_\epsilon$. Next, we will not allow the full $\rm N_i$ electrons to interact with each ion as this is unphysical. Instead, only a small number of the total ions $\rm N_\epsilon$ are allowed to have encounters for each energy deposit, illustrated in \ref{fig:Flucs_Fig}. The value of $\rm N_\epsilon$ is set by the requirement to reproduce the correct recombination probability. The observed recombination probability r is then written as,

\begin{equation}
\rm r=r_s+(N_\epsilon-1) r_\epsilon = N_\epsilon r_\epsilon
\label{eq:Simp1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where r is the observed recombination probability at a given energy, $\rm r_s$ is the self recombination probability taken to be equal to the encounter recombination probability $\rm r_\epsilon$, and $\rm N_\epsilon$ is the average number of electron encounters for each ion. Note that the value of $\rm N_\epsilon$ used is an average and can also vary event to event depending on the ER track geometry. The equation for recombination probability in \ref{eq:Simp1} inadvertently solves the other issue of the original recombination model. By taking self recombination $\rm r_s$ to be equal to $\rm r_\epsilon$ the observed recombination probability r naturally vanishes as the energy ($\rm N_i$) tends to zero, as observed in the data shown in figure \ref{fig:R_T}. The binomial variance of such a process is,

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} = (1-N_\epsilon r_\epsilon)N_\epsilon r_\epsilon N_i
\label{eq:SimpVar}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} $ is the recombination variance in number of quanta squared for a given interaction with $\rm N_i$ ions, encounter recombination probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ with an average of $\rm N_\epsilon$ encounters. The variance derived in equation \ref{eq:SimpVar} grown like $\rm N_i$ and suffers the same problem as our original model. The variance needs to grow like $\rm N_i^2$ to explain the observed recombination fluctuations in the data, as seen in the previous subsection. 

The solution is surprisingly straight forward considering the two requirements. First, in order to maintain the correct recombination probability r the value of  encounter interactions $\rm N_\epsilon$ must be fixed. Second, to get the additional factor of $\rm N_i$ in variance the process of size  $\rm N_\epsilon$ must be be repeated, with the repetition scaling like $\rm N_i$. Remember, we are only allowing a small number, $\rm N_\epsilon$, of the total ions available ions to have encounters. Consider the picture in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Fig} but for $\rm N_\epsilon$ encounters repeated $\rm N_i/N_\epsilon$ times in $\rm N_C$ clusters, such a process is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Fig_Cluster}. The number of clusters $\rm N_C$ for a given in equation \ref{eq:N_C}. 

\begin{equation}
\rm N_C = N_i/N_\epsilon
\label{eq:N_C}
\end{equation}

\caption{Illustration of recombination for the case of a in single ion occurring in $\rm N_C$ clusters with number of encounters $\rm N_\epsilon$. The total recombination probability for all clusters is equal to the average of each individual cluster. In each cluster the recombination probability is equal to the number of interaction $\rm N_\epsilon$ times the encounter recombination probability $\rm r_\epsilon$. The process is repeated for $\rm N_C$ clusters, resulting in and additional factor $\rm N_i$ in the observed variance while maintaining the correct average recombination probability r. }

The value $\rm N_\epsilon$ can be considered as the number of encounters per cluster, or generalized to the number of ions per cluster. The electron-ion pairs have $\rm N_\epsilon$ encounters in each cluster with an average recombination probability r. The total recombination probability of the system of clusters remains equal to $\rm r=\rm N_\epsilon r_\epsilon$ without blowing up to unity. Since the process is repeated for $\rm N_C$ clusters the variance from equation \ref{eq:SimpVar} becomes

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} =  \sum\limits_{N_C}(1-N_\epsilon r_\epsilon)N_\epsilon r_\epsilon N_i
\label{eq:SimpVar_C}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} $ is the recombination variance of equation \ref{eq:SimpVar} for $\rm N_C$ clusters. Plugging in the value of $\rm N_C$ from equation \ref{eq:N_C} we find

\begin{equation}
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} =  (1-N_\epsilon r_\epsilon)N_\epsilon r_\epsilon N_i (N_i/N_\epsilon)
\label{eq:SimpVar_C}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the multiplication by $\rm N_C$ is written as $\rm N_i/N_\epsilon$. Further simplifying equation \ref{eq:SimpVar_C} and recalling that $\rm r=N_\epsilon r_\epsilon$,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} =  (1-N_\epsilon r_\epsilon) r_\epsilon N_i^2 \\
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} =  (1-r) r_\epsilon N_i^2 \\
\rm Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon} =  (1-r) r \frac{N_i^2}{N_\epsilon} 
\end{split}
\label{eq:SimpVar_C_2}
\end{equation}

\noindent Taking the result for variance given in equation \ref{eq:SimpVar_C_2} we calculate the apparent amplification factor $\rm \mathcal{A}$ over that of a binomial process, our original recombination theory. 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm \mathcal{A} = \frac{Var_{N_\epsilon r_\epsilon}}{Var_{r}} = \frac{(1-r)r N_i^2/N\epsilon}{(1-r)rN_i} \\
%\rm \mathcal{A} = \frac{r_\epsilon N_i}{r} \\
\rm \mathcal{A} = \frac{N_i}{N_\epsilon} = N_C
\end{split}
\label{eq:Simp_Amp}
\end{equation}

\noindent the amplification factor in equation \ref{eq:Simp_Amp} remarkably simple. The amplification over that of a binomial process reduces to the number of clusters $\rm N_C$. Note, the value of $\rm N_\epsilon$ is the ratio of $\rm r/r_\epsilon$. This is the key to the cluster recombination model. We have picked up an additional factor $\rm N_i$ in the variance while maintaining the correct average recombination probability r. Using equation \ref{eq:Simp_Amp} we can extract the encounter probability $\rm r_\epsilon$, the cluster size $\rm N_\epsilon$ and the number of clusters $\rm N_C$ from our calibration data.

The average value of $\rm r_\epsilon$ over a wide range of energies is found to be 0.01, shown in figure \ref{fig:Simple_re}. The value of  $\rm r_\epsilon$ determined by using the cluster-encounter model is consistent with that noted by Mozumder in 1995 to explain ion fluctuations in liquid xenon \cite{Mozumder}. The value of  $\rm r_\epsilon=0.01$ corresponds to an average value of encounters $\rm N_\epsilon = 50$, which can be thought of as the cluster size. Figure \ref{fig:Simple_re} (c) also shows the number of clusters vs. energy, which grows linearly with $\rm N_i$.  Note, the number of clusters is the factor by which the binomial fluctuations of the initial self-recombination model are amplified at at given energy.


The number of interaction per cluster $\rm N_\epsilon$, or cluster size, sets the encounter probability $\rm r_\epsilon$ in this model. The value of $\rm N_\epsilon$ appears to level off around 25 as energy tends to zero and varies between 25 to 100 over a wide range of energies and electric fields. Both $\rm r_\epsilon$ and $\rm N_\epsilon$ appear to have dependencies on electric field and energy . Which is not surprising as both the track geometry and interaction probability depend on electric field and energy. The data from Dahl over the range of 60 to 5000 V/cm especially illuminates the dependancies vs. field. We proceed with a simplified model and take the value of  $\rm N_\epsilon$ as a constant. The average value of $\rm N_\epsilon =50$ is used to calculate the expected variance at each energy using equation \ref{eq:Simp_Amp}, the result is shown in figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Simple}.

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:Flucs_Simple} shows the measured recombination fluctuations vs. energy along with that expected for the clustering model given in equation \ref{eq:SimpVar_C_2}, for $\rm N_\epsilon =50 $, corresponding to an average encounter recombination probability of $\rm r_\epsilon = 0.01$. The deviation of the fit and the data is less than 30\%, including Dahl's data taken at electric fields ranging from 60 to 5000 V/cm. 

With the clustered encounter model we can now account for the recombination fluctuations and understand why recombination tends to zero as energy tends to zero. Having explained these two PEnomena, the clustered-encounter model is a significant improvement over the initial recombination model. The flaw of the initial recombination model was to assume that the recombination process only consists of ion-electron pair self recombination. This assumption is what lead to the observed variance being off by a factor of $\rm N_i$ and the inability to explain the dependance of recombination fraction as energy tends to zero. The picture of ER band mean and width is now complete, only requiring recombination fraction r as an input. The recombination fraction is dependent on the energy of the interaction and electric field, modeled by Thomas \& Imel \cite{Thomas_Imel} and NEST \cite{NEST}, \cite{NEST_2013}.

\section{Conclusion}

%This should be the conclusion after showing the ER band and alpha...

There have been numerous steps in this section culminating in expanding our knowledge by extracting as much information as possible from the calibration sources. We have measured that the best exciton to ion ratio $\rm \alpha$ measured to be 0.20 in the WIMP search energies, which is consistent with the measurement from \cite{Doke_alpha}. The value of alpha was constrained by extrapolating the recombination fluctuations from the tritium data from 3 to 1.2 keV and requiring that for a single ion-electron pair the fluctuation be purely binomial, shown in figure \ref{fig:Alpha_T}.

The recombination model presented in this section can be used to predict the ER band for any xenon detector, as shown in figure \ref{fig:ER_Band_Calc}. The most critical results are those specific to our WIMP search, 10-100 GeV WIMPs, which are focused in the range of 1 to 5 $\rm keV_{ee}$ and well covered by the tritium calibration data. Having extracted the values of r and $\rm \sigma_r$ for ER events the generic mean and band widths can be determined. Thus, the ER band shape can be determined for any xenon detector with the application of the additional variance from the specific detector resolution. The knowledge of this band shape can be used to make predictions about the background rejection power of a given experiment. 

It is surprising to find that changing the drift filed from 100 V/cm to 170 V/cm had only an epsilon impact on the mean of ER band below 4 $\rm keV_{ee}$, figure \ref{fig:ER_Band_Calc}. Further, there was no impact on the energy threshold since the light and charge yields merge at the threshold of 1 keV. A more dramatic field dependance was expected from \cite{Dahl_Thesis} and \cite{NEST_2013}. However, the low energy region never been probed to such high precision as with the tritium calibration using the LUX detector. To expand upon the modeling at low energies it will be useful for the next science run using the LUX detector to take tritium calibration data at a verity of fields. This will allow us to predict exactly how much additional NR and ER discrimination can be achieved by increasing the field. %We also want to explore if the recombination fluctuation can truly be thought of an an amplification of the variance over that of the underlying binomial process of electron-ion pair recombination.
