Left: The y axis is the ratio of the measured standard deviation of recombination to that of a binomial processes and is plotted vs. the expected binomial standard deviation on the x axis. The best $\rm  \alpha $ is one for which the observed standard deviation converges with that of a binomial process as the binomial variance tends to 1. Right, the same y axis as on the left but plotted vs. the number of ions available for recombination. As the number of ions approaches one the standard deviation of recombination should become that of a binomial process. A single ion will either recombine or not with probability r. The best intercept converging to a purely binomial process (black star) is with $\rm  \alpha $ = 0.20.

Left: The y axis is the ratio of the measured standard deviation of recombination to that of a binomial processes and is plotted vs. the expected binomial standard deviation on the x axis. The best $\rm \alpha $ is one for which the observed standard deviation converges with that of a binomial process as the binomial variance tends to 1. Right, the same y axis as on the left but plotted vs. the number of ions available for recombination. As the number of ions approaches one the standard deviation of recombination should become that of a binomial process. A single ion will either recombine or not with probability r. The best intercept converging to a purely binomial process (black star) is with $\rm \alpha $ = 0.20. Falling below the value of one on the y axis implies that recombining electron-ion pairs have a variance better than binomial, which is unphysical if it is a random process. Note, the fits use only data above 90\% threshold at 1.3 keV, starting from the third data point from the left. The higher end cut off at 3 keV corresponds to the end of the fitted lines. \relax \relax }{figure.caption.74}{}}
