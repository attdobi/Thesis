First and foremost, I'd like to thank my advisor Professor Carter Hall, for giving me the opportunity to have worked with him over the past years. I would have ended up in a boring nuclear engineering job had it not been for his intervention. He has always made time for me and has provided me with invaluable insight. I appreciate all your help over the years, I have learned a great deal from you.

I've been fortunate to have been surrounded by talented coworkers all who have helped me to become. Simon, Ruey, Clayton, Tom, Richard, Jon, Doug, I will cherish my graduate experience having worked in the lab with you all.

I would also like to thank Professor Richard Gaitskell and the entire group at Brown University, to whom I owe my familiarity with LUX data analysis and data processing. Jeremy, Dave, James, Monica, Carlos, Alastair, Simon F non of this analysis work would have been possible without your guidance. I would especially like to thank Carlos and his wife Fatma for their generosity.

I owe gratitude to all members of the LUX collaboration for contributing towards the development, construction and commissioning of the LUX detector. It was an enormous effort by all, and you built the most sensitive WIMP dark matter detector. Special thanks to Patrick, Markus, Jeremy, Carmen, Scott, Ethan, Mongkol, Mia, Rachel, Nicole for making being onsite an amazing experience.

To Matthew, Patrick, Tom Shutt, I am grateful for all the discussions we've had on topic of fluctuations in liquid xenon. 

All of the personnel at the Sanford Underground laboratory in lead South Dakota deserve special mention. They keep our experiment running smoothing one mile underground, no easy task. 

I'd like to acknowledge all my friends who have helped take my mind off physics over the years. Henry, Kyle, Vibhu and Norvik. Special thanks to Kristy and Moose. Also, my friends in Hungary who always make sure I'm well fed, Adam, Petya, N\'{a}ndi, Enik\H{o} and my cousin Zoli. 

My family members have always been there for me. I could not have made it with the support from my step father, grandparents, sister and mother. Szeretlek! And our dog Rocco.


It is impossible to remember all so many people have helped me along the way, and I apologize to those I've inadvertently left out.
