\section{LUX 2013 Science Run Reanalysis}

The LUX collaboration is currently working on an updated analysis of the 2013 science run, initially published in \cite{LUX_PRL}. The reanalysis will include an improved characterization of the ER band, using the tritium data. The measurement of the NR mean has also been improved with calibration using a DD neutron generator. The new ER discrimination factor, from the improved calibration, are described in section \ref{sec:ER_Discrim}. The tritium calibration set contains twenty times the statistics of the calibration used for the initial LUX WIMP result \cite{LUX_PRL}. With the high statistics, the ER discrimination used in the profile likelihood analysis will be purely data-driven. Past experiments have assumed Gaussian behavior about the ER mean, however the tritium calibration has unveiled  non-Gaussian tails of the ER band past three sigma of the mean (for energies between 1 to 10 $\rm keV_{ee}$).

In addition to ER discrimination, described in chapter \ref{Ch:T}, the updated WIMP analysis will benefit from improved background modeling using the data presented in chapters \ref{Ch:E_Scale_Cal}, \ref{Ch:Flucs}, \ref{Ch:LYQY}. The scintillation and ionization yields measured from the tritium calibration is also being used to improve upon the NEST package. With the improvements the low energy depositions of $\rm \gamma$ and $\rm \beta$ backgrounds can be precisely converted into of the observables (S1 and S2). 


\section{Fundamental Properties of Liquid Xenon}
In chapter \ref{Ch:Flucs} event-to-event fluctuations are discussed. The fluctuations are caused by electron-ion recombination in the liquid xenon and detector resolution. It is found that the recombination fluctuations grow like the number of ions squared, discrediting modeling based on a binomial recombination process. Future experiments, with lower photon detection thresholds, will be able to shed more light on recombination using the tritium calibration source. At low energies, as the number of ion-electron pairs goes to one, it may be found that recombination fluctuation do indeed tend to that of a binomial process.

In chapter \ref{Ch:LYQY} the scintillation and ionization yield of xenon was constrained and found consistent with other measurement, having rather large systematic errors. The errors on the yield measurement were dominated by the constant on gains $\rm g_1$ and $\rm g_2$. In future calibration we plan to tighten the constraints on the gains in order to measure the light yield and charge yield to within 5\%.

\section{Internal Calibration Sources}
The tritiated methane source developed by LUX solves the problem of ER calibration, for any detector in the foreseeable future. No matter how big a detector gets, the self-shielding is overcome by mixing the source with the xenon and then removing it. The implementation of the tritiated-methane source is also an important proof of principle that even a long lived radio active isotope can be injected into a xenon detector for calibration purposes. As a complement to the tritiated-methane calibration source, we have developed a method track trace impurities in the xenon gas to the parts-per-trillion ($\rm 10^{-12}$) level, with a specific focus on methane and krypton detection \cite{coldtrap}, \cite{Dobi_CH4}, \cite{Kr_ppt_Dobi}. Having such a system is what ultimately allowed for the use of the source with the LUX detector. We could characterize both the removal and diffusion of natural-methane specifically for the LUX detector, with no reliance of diffusion modeling into plastic components. 

The methodology used for the tritium source can be transferred over for use with other sources. Any new radioactive isotope can be introduced into the xenon as long as its removal (either chemically or through distillation) can be tracked by the gas analysis system. Having characterized methane removal from liquid xenon, methane molecule with $\rm ^{14}C$ could also be used as a calibration source. There may be a variety of molecules that could be radio-tagged . As long as the molecule can be observed by the gas analysis system the purification efficientcy and diffusion rate can be measured and thus carefully used as a calibration source for a xenon detector.
