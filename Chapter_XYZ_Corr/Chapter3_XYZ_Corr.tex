\chapter{Spacial Dependent Correction of the S1 and S2 Signals}
\label{Ch:3}

In this chapter we address the spacial dependent corrections applied to the S1 and S2 signal. The S2 position dependent correction is dominated by the z dependent electron attenuation. S2s of equal sizes are exponentially attenuated with increasing depth in the detector. The S1 position dependent correction normalizes for photon detection probability as a function of the event origin given the x,y,z coordinate. %Variation in LY and QY vs. Z is folded into the S1 and S2 correction.
Knowing the x,y,z position of each event provides a powerful tool for reducing variations in the signals due to detector geometry. The better we can correct for position dependance of the S1 and S2 signals the smaller the observed variations will be, leading to better ER, NR discrimination and ultimately better signal to background for the WIMP search. 

\section{$\rm^{83m}Kr$ Calibration}

Throughout the science run periodic $\rm^{83m}Kr$ injections were performed to calculate position dependent corrections. $\rm ^{83m}Kr$ is produced from the decay $\rm^{83}Rb$ with a half life of 86.2 days. The $\rm^{83}Rb$ source used is housed in charcoal and plumbed directly into the LUX circulation system. A decay scheme of \Rb and \KrCal is shown in figure \ref{fig:Kr_Decay}.

\label{fig:Kr_Decay}
\end{figure}

\noindent The daughter \KrCal is continually produced in the charcoal housing, having a half-life 1.8 hours. $\rm^{83m}Kr$ decays via an electron capture first emitting a 32.1 keV x-ray followed by a 9.4 keV x-ray with a half life of 154 ns between the two \cite{Start_Kr} \cite{Kastens}.  For the vast majority of the decays the combined S1 pulse corresponding to (41.55 keV) is observed, since the minimum S1 pulse separation in the LUX reconstruction is 1000 ns. Figure \ref{fig:Kr_Waveform} shows two \KrCal waveforms (S1 and S2) with the the decay of the 32.1 and 9.4 keV x-ray split by 60 and 220 ns, both S1s shown are classified as a single S1 event. The timing separation between the S1 and S2 is used to infer the drift distance to be 14.0 and 40.0 cm below the liquid surface, respectively. The degradation of the S2 signal that originated from deeper in the detector is apparent by comparing the amplitudes of the S2, with roughly 50\% charge loss. The S2 pulses are insensitive to the timing separation of the dual decay as electron diffusion smears the pulses two together as the electrons drift through the active region before extraction \cite{Electron_Diffusion}.

\newpage

The \KrCal source is introduced when needed into the LUX detector by flushing the charcoal housing with xenon and diverting the flow inline with the main circulation path. The \KrCal source and delivery into the xenon detector is described in more detail in \cite{Kastens}. The relatively short half-life of 1.8 hours allows for several injections per week without interrupting WIMP search data taking. Once injected the source is uniformly mixed into the liquid xenon within a matter of minutes and can be used to calculate corrections for the XYZ the response of the detector. Decay of \KrCal produces a well defined mono energetic peak as it decays in the xenon (shown in section \ref{Ch:E_Scale_Cal}). Tracking the peak vs. x,y,z allows for the detector's spacial dependent response to be gauged over the course of the science run. Figure \ref{fig:Kr_Dist} shows the uniform distribution of \KrCal events in the LUX detector thirty minutes after the injection.

\section{S2 Electron Lifetime and x,y Correction}

As mentioned previously, the S1 and S2 signals collected on the top and bottom PMT arrays have well defined x,y,z positions computed from the S2 hit pattern (x,y) and the signal separation in time (z). The dominant effect to correct the data for is the free electron lifetime, as charge is drifted from the event site to the extraction region (0-47 cm) electronegative impurities in the liquid latch onto them. These impurities include residual $\rm O_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm N_2$ in the xenon (1 ppb $\rm O_2$ corresponds to a 100 $\rm \mu s$ lifetime [ref]). Throughout the 2013 science run the electron lifetime was measured between 500 to 1000 $\rm \mu s$, or an attenuation length of 75 to 150 cm with a drift velocity of $\rm 1.51 mm/\mu s$. The measured electron lifetimes (or attenuation lengths) correspond to between 70\% and 50\% reduction in S2 signal from the cathode grid, the bottom of the active region.
 
The electron lifetime is calculated by binning the detector in drift time into 60 slices. In each bin a Gaussian is fit to extract the mean. Once the mean in each slice is calculated, an exponential is fit to the mean S2 response vs. z. The exponential time constant the measure of the characteristic drift time $\tau$ [$\rm \mu s$], shown in figure \ref{fig:S2_EL}. The characteristic attenuation length is $\lambda = \tau v_{drift}$, where $v_{drift}$ is the electron drift velocity. The electron lifetime extraction from a $\rm^{83}Kr$ data set is shown in figure 4.  For this analysis present S2 response on the bottom PMT array ($\rm S2_b$) as it was used for the preliminary WIMP search analysis discussed in \ref{Ch:2}. Corrections for top only, bottom only, and all PMTs are computed for each \KrCal calibration data set.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
\includegraphics[width=75mm]{Chapter_XYZ_Corr/Thesis_Corr_Plots/S2_bottom_hist_EL.eps}

\caption{Left: Fits to the mean of $\rm S2_b$ of the \KrCal data in several z slices. Right, the exponential fit to the means of $\rm S2_b$ vs. drift time used to extract electron lifetime $\rm \tau$. }
\label{fig:S2_EL}
\end{figure}

The z corrected $\rm S2_b$ from each signal is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\rm S2_{\operatorname{b-z}}=S2_b\cdot exp\left(\frac{drift\,time[\mu s]}{\tau[\mu s]}\right)
\label{eq:S2_Z}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where $\rm S2_{\operatorname{b-z}}$ is the z corrected $\rm S2_b$ signal and $\rm \tau$ is the free electron lifetime. The S2 signal has x,y dependent variations due to non uniformities in the extraction field, tilt in the liquid level, and non uniformities in the anode-gate separation (potentially wire sagging). The S2 light is emitted as the electrons are extracted at a given x,y position from the liquid surface and accelerated by a 6 kV potential, traversing 5mm from the liquid surface to the anode. After correcting the dominant z dependent electron attenuation, corrected to 0 drift time, we calculate the normalization factor ($\mathcal{NF}$) that will be used to correct for the x,y dependent variations ing the S2 signal.

The normalization is calculated by creating a 25x25 grid on the x,y plane, corresponding to 2[cm] x 2[cm] x,y bins, for each bin center the average light response is determined by fitting a Gaussian. Figure \ref{fig:S2_XY_norm_center} on the left, shows the measured $\rm S2_b$ response to 1 million $\rm^{83m}Kr$ decays normalized to the response at the center, x=y=0, this map represents the inverse of the normalization factor that we call $\rm\mathcal{NF}(x,y)$. $\mathcal{NF}$ is then applied to the $\rm S2_b$ data by using a spline interpolation of the x,y coordinate of each event relative to the bin centers $\rm\mathcal{NF}(x,y)$. Figure \ref{fig:S2_XY_norm_center} on the right, shows the $\rm S2_b$ response after correcting the data relative to the center x=y=0 using $\rm\mathcal{NF}(x,y)$. After applying the x,y correction the fluctuation decrease from 10\% to 1\% in the inner 18 cm of the detector (the fiducial volume).

\caption{Left: Response of $\rm S2_b$ vs. x,y normalized to the response at the center (x=y=0). Right: Response of $\rm S2_b$ vs. x,y after correcting the data using $\rm\mathcal{NF}_{S2_b}$. }
\label{fig:S2_XY_norm_center}
\end{figure}


After correcting for z and x,y we can define the position dependent  (x,y,z) corrected $\rm S2_b$ signal, which we will call $\rm S2{_b}_c$ calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\rm S2_{\operatorname{b-c}}= S2_{\operatorname{b-(x,z,y)}}=S2_{\operatorname{b-z}} \cdot \mathcal{NF}_{S2_b}(x,y)
\label{eq:S2_XYZ}
\end{equation}

Where $\rm S2_{\operatorname{b-c}}$ is the x,y,z corrected $\rm S2_b$ signal and $\rm \mathcal{NF}_{S2_b}(x,y)$ is the Normalization Factor'of the bottom PMT array for S2s and is a function of x,y. The interpolation of the inverse of $\rm \mathcal{NF}_{S2_b}(x,y)$ along the x,y grid is plotted in figure \ref{fig:S2_XY_norm_center}.


After applying the z correction to $\rm S2_b$ there is an improvement in resolution of 18\%, for the case of an 750 $\rm \mu s$ electron lifetime. The correcting in the x,y plane provides an additional 4.9\% improvement in resolution to the $\rm S2_b$ signal. Figure \ref{fig:S2_res} shows the improvement in the $\rm S2_b$ signal after applying the z and x,y correction.

\end{figure}



\section{S1 x,y,z Correction}

The S1 light propagates from the interaction sight, unlike the S2, and has about a 30\% variation in light collection efficiency between events near the top and bottom of the detector. About 2/3 of the S1 light is collected on the bottom PMT arrays due to total internal reflection at the liquid gas interface, and as events move closer to the bottom PMTs the probability of a photon stricking a PMT and producing a photo electron (PE) increases. Other position dependent effects include the photon absorption length which is negligible at the purities achieved in LUX and teflon reflectivity, about 95\%. Any quantum efficiency (QE) variations between the 122 PMTs that are properly normalized by the individual gain corrections are also folded into the S1 position dependent correction, measured from the $\rm^{83m}Kr$ calibrations.
To calculate the x,y,z dependent Normalization Factor for S1 ($\rm \mathcal{NF}_{S1}$) the detector is divided into a 25x25x16 x,y,z mesh with each voxel having dimensions of 2[cm] x 2[cm] x 20[$\rm \mu s$]. To achieve sufficient statistics for correcting we require at least 400,000 $\rm^{83m}Kr$ events, giving about 40 events per voxel to define the mean. However, we perform monthly high stats calibrations that produce 1 million counts providing precise $\mathcal{NF}$ correction maps. Unlike the S2 correction, which is highly dependent on purity, the S1 has been found to be invariant to within a percent over the course of the science run, thus monthly calibrations with high stats are sufficient to provide the position dependent correction.

Figure \ref{fig:S1_XYZ_norm_center} shows the response of the detector to $\rm^{83m}Kr$ normalized to the center of the detector in 16 slices of z, each with a 2[cm] x 2[cm] x,y grid. The plotted maps and normalized to the center of the detector and represent the inverse of the normalization factor ($\rm \mathcal{NF}_{S1}$). We choose to normalize the the center of the detector as it represents the overall average light collection efficiency of the detector as this value varies roughly linearly from top to bottom, with lower light collection at the top and higher light collection at the bottom. Though the dominate correction is the z dependance there is also substructure to each z slice in x,y which is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:S1_XYZ_norm_center_slice}, where we have normalized each slice to its own center. Plotting in this way it is evident that near the top and bottom there are additional geometric effects near the edges, whereas in the central z slices the uniformity in x,y is much better due to increased scattering off the teflon.

\label{fig:S1_XYZ_norm_center_slice}
\end{figure}

We define the position dependent  (x,y,z) corrected S1 signal as $\rm S1{_c}$, normalized to the center of the detector (x=y=0 and z=160$\rm \mu s$) calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\rm S1_{c}= S1_{(x,z,y)}=S1 \cdot \mathcal{NF}_{S1}(x,y,z)
\label{eq:S1_XYZ}
\end{equation}

Where $\rm S1_{c}$ is the x,y,z corrected S1 signal and $\rm \mathcal{NF}_{S1}(x,y,z)$ is the Normalization Factor of the sum of all PMTs for S1s and is a function of x,y,z. The interpolation of the inverse of $\rm \mathcal{NF}_{S1}(x,y,z)$ along the x,y grid in z slices is plotted in figure \ref{fig:S1_XYZ_norm_center}. The normalization factor is applied to the S1 data by using a spline interpolation of the x,y,z coordinate of each event relative to the bin centers $\rm \mathcal{NF}_{S1}(x,z,y)$. Figure \ref{fig:S1_XYZ_norm_center} shows the S1 response after correcting the data relative to the center of the detector. After applying the x,y,z correction the position dependent variations decrease to less than1\% in the inner 18 cm of the detector (the fiducial volume), with as much as 3\% variations near the top and bottom edges were the interpolation breaks down.

\caption{S1 x,y,z response normalized to the center of the detector after the data has been corrected and normalized to the detector center.

\label{fig:S1_XYZ_norm_center}
\end{figure}

After applying the z correction to S1 there is an improvement in resolution of 31.5\%. The correcting in z and the x,y plane provides an additional 2.0\% improvement in resolution in S1 over the z only correction. Figure \ref{fig:S1_res} shows the improvement in the S1 signal after applying the z and x,y,z correction.

\section{Application to x,y,z Corrections in Data Processing}

As mentioned earlier, the purpose of the periodic \KrCal calibrations were to produce position dependent S1 and S2 corrections over the corse of the science run. Before processing the WIMP search data the calibration sets were processed and a MYSQL table of electron lifetimes and corrections maps were populated for each date. The electron lifetime applied to each WIMP search data set was a linear interpolation between calibration dates, for the x,y correction the nearest $\rm \mathcal{NF}_{S2}(x,y)$ entry in time was used. Combined these produced the corrected $\rm S2_c$ quantity to be used for the WIMP analysis. For the S1 x,y,z corrections the nearest $\rm \mathcal{NF}_{S1}(x,y,z)$ entry was used to produced the corrected $\rm S1_c$ quantity. For both the S2-x,y and S1-x,y,z correction the time dependance is assumed to be neglidgable as these are geometric effects, whereas the electron lifetime varies with purity daily.
The electron lifetime and the stability of the z dependent S1 correction over the corse of the first science run is shown in figure \ref{fig:S2_EL_time} and \ref{fig:S1_center_time}. While the electron lifetime needs frequent monitoring the S1 x,y,z response is fixed over several months of running.
For the results discussed in the subsequent sections of the thesis we will only work with the x,y,z corrected S1 and $\rm S2_b$ pulses defined at $\rm S1_c$ and $\rm S2{_b}_c$ respectively.
