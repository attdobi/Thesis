We describe the development, deployment, and exploitation of a tritium calibration source for the LUX dark matter experiment. 
The source is useful for calibrating the electron recoil backgrounds over the full volume of the detector, and for characterizing the behavior of the LUX TPC. We report on the LUX electron recoil discrimination factor, the detector threshold, and on the detector physics of liquid xenon at the LUX electric field value of 181 V/cm.
