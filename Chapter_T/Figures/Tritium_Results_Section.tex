\section{Tritium as a Calibration Source}

Due to the self shielding properties of liquid xenon it is practically impossible to perform a low energy electronic recoil (ER) calibration within the fiducial volume of a +100 kg detector using an external source. The fiducial volume of the LUX detector is surrounded by more than than 6 cm of liquid xenon providing excellent shielding from both external backgrounds and calibration sources. For example, a 100 keV gamma has a mean free path of about 2 mm in liquid xenon and would require thirty mean free paths to penetrate into the fiducial volume. A higher energy source such as $\rm ^{137}Cs$ (662 keV) has a longer mean free path of 4 cm however, the probability of a low energy deposit from forward scattering is greatly suppressed. Further, calibrating within the fiducial volume by relying on gammas from an external source to forward scatter brings along systematic uncertainties from high energy deposits near the edge, DAQ rate and having to use  multi scatter event selection instead of a standard set of single scatter WIMP search cuts. An ideal ER calibration source for current and next generation noble gas detectors should consist of single scatter events depositing sub 10 keV energies uniformly distributed in the fiducial region. These requirements are all satisfied by tritium beta decay. Tritium has a Q value of 18.6 keV \cite{Tritium_Q}, a mean beta energy of 5.6 keV \cite{Tritium_Mean} and a mode of 3 keV \cite{Tritium_Eq} making it an ideal low energy internal calibration source, so long as it can removed after calibration. The half-life of tritium is 12.3 years \cite{Tritium_halflife_all} thus it is not practical to wait for the activity to decay away as with other standard internal calibration sources [kr83 ref], the tritium must be removed after the calibration is complete. To mitigate the effect of tritium diffusion into plastics we use tritiated methane instead of bare tritium. For tritiated methane, a tritium atom along with three hydrogen atoms are bound to a carbon molecule. Using tritiated methane lessens the diffusion of tritium into detector internals by an order of magnitude \cite{miyake:1983}. The weak molecular bond, sub on eV, to the methane molecule does not impact the nuclear physics of the tritium beta decay. We have studied the removal of methane by the commonly used SAES heated zirconium getter and found that significant amounts of methane can be removed from xenon at flow rates commonly employed in large scale liquid xenon experiments \cite{Dobi_CH4},\cite{coldtrap}.

\section{Results from the Tritiated Methane Calibration}

\subsection{Tritiated Methane injection into the LUX detector}

In the experimental setup at UMD it was demonstrated that tritiated methane could be injected directly into a liquid xenon vessel containing plastics and removed. However, even with conservative estimates of diffusion rates into mock plastic components we could not be certain about the diffusion of methane in the much larger LUX detector. Having an integrated xenon gas sampling system, developed for LUX to monitor krypton daily \cite{Kr_ppt_Dobi} \cite{EXO_SAM}, allowed us to conduct situ methane measurements providing a diagnostic of the natural methane diffusion without the risk of permanent tritium contamination. Before injecting tritiated methane into the detector we first injected $\rm 1/10^{6}$ (g/g) of natural methane and demonstrated its removal from the LUX xenon to five orders of magnitude, this allowed us to proceed with confidence knowing that the goal of reducing the tritium rate to less than 5\% of background could be met. Methane is chemically identical to tritiated methane and having the ability to sample the gas proved useful for the tritium campaign, the purification time constant for natural methane removal was measured to be $\rm 5.9 \pm 0.07$ hours with the xenon gas sampling system \ref{fig:Removal_methane}. The removal time constant was $\rm 1/5$ of that expected based on xenon circulation rates alone, potentially enhanced by the solubility of methane between the liquid and gaseous xenon. The enhanced purification time constant allowed for larger injections of tritiated methane into the detector. 


Following the natural methane test the tritiated methane injection was conducted. An absolute activity of 20 mBq of tritiated methane was injected at the purifier's outlet while circulating. A removal time constant of $\rm 6.0 \pm 0.5$ hours was measured in the liquid volume, consistent with the natural methane removal measured in the gas by the sampling system \ref{fig:Removal}. After a day of circulating through the getter the tritium rate had fallen below detectable levels confirming the effective removal of the tritiated methane with the getter. A second, larger injection of 800 mBq was performed a week later yielding a similar removal time constant of $\rm 6.4 \pm 0.1$. The second injection produced 20,000 beta decays in the LUX detector before being completely removed, 7000 of which were in the fiducial volume and could used to calibrate the ER band in the WIMP search region of 1-50 Phe (about 1-8 $\rm keV{ee}$). The new tritium calibration source provided an unprecedented low energy electronic recoil calibration for the LUX dark matter search \cite{LUX_PRL}. The injections were performed while circulating and with the getter actively purifying in order maintain detector purity and stability. Prior to LUX detector upgrades in December of 2013 a total of 10 Bq of tritiated methane was injected into the LUX detector and successfully removed providing over 150,000 beta decays within the fiducial volume. 

%The $\rm CH_3T$ (tritiated methane) was injected at the getter output and had passed through a special methane purifier to remove $\rm O_2$, $\rm H_2O$ and other electronegative impurities that could cause a degradation in election lifetime. 

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering

\caption{Removal of natural methane observed by the integrated xenon sampling system prior to the tritiated methane injections. The red points indicate measurements at the getter outlet, we find a 97\% one pass removal efficiency at a flow rate of 25 SLPM. The blue curve shows the improved upper limit on the effect of outgassing from the plastics. The black dashed lines shows the exponential fit to the natural methane removal from the xenon with a time constant of 5.9 $\pm 0.07$ hours. $\rm 5\times10^{-3}$ ppb (g/g) is the limit of detection for methane.}
\label{fig:Removal_methane}
\end{figure}

In addition to providing a direct measure of the removal rate of methane from LUX, the natural methane injection allowed a stronger and more direct limit to be placed on the outgassing from the plastics. As seen in figure \ref{fig:Removal_Methane}, the highest value allowed for the outgassing constant is 0.0016 cm/day$^{1/2}$, which is in agreement with the lower limit discussed in section 2. We call this an upper limit because the apparent elbow observed in the data occurs at the sensitivity limit of the sampling system. With the measurement of both the outgassing constant, and the removal rate of methane, it is now possible to place strong limits on the time cost of performing a tritiated methane calibration, as shown in figure \ref{fig:cal_time}.

\subsection{Mixing of Tritiated Methane in Liquid Xenon}

Tritium events appear uniformly distributed in the liquid volume several minutes after injecting the tritiated methane inline with the xenon gas circulation path. Figure \ref{fig:Density} shows the $\rm R^2$ vs. Z distribution of tritium events thirty minutes after an injection. The events shown cover the region from the gate to the cathode and radially outward to the edge of the detector. An additional cut requiring that the event be between $\rm \pm 3 \sigma$ of the ER mean was made to disregard residual alpha events from the walls and cathode, the event rate consisted overwhelmingly of tritium events. The tritiated methane dispersed uniformly throughout the liquid xenon illuminating all regions on the detector.

\subsection{Definition of Electronic Recoil Band and Comparison with NEST Model}

The electronic recoil band in the fiducial volume of the LUX detector was calibrated to unprecedented accuracy using the tritium source. Figure \ref{fig:Band} shows the tritium calibration data with fits to the mean of the ER band along with the 10-90\% confidence bounds ($\pm 1.28\sigma$), at a drift field of 180 V/cm. The values of the leakage fraction at 50\% NR acceptance per each 1 Phe bin in S1 are shown in \ref{fig:Leak}. The nuclear recoil band, in red, is defined by the NEST model along with AmBe and $\rm^{252}Cf$  calibrations. The amount of methane injected to perform the calibration was less than 1 part-per-trillion ($\rm <10^{-12}$) far to small to cause degradation in electron lifetime or quench xenon scintillation \cite{Kirill_Methane}. We have also independently verified the null impact on electron lifetime and light yield by performing a tritiated methane while taking $\rm ^{83m}Kr$ calibration data [cite, thesis].

% Carter's line: Methane will not quench xenon scintillation,  even if methane is introduced into the xenon at a relative concentration of a few percent, then the amount of scintillation produced by the mixture is reduced by a factor of two compared to pure xenon \cite{Kirill_Methane}. But for our application we require a methane concentration of only one part in $\rm10^{15}$, and therefore our methane injection will not have any negative effects on scintillation production and transport.

WIMPs primarily interact with the atomic nuclei of xenon atoms in LUX resulting in nuclear recoils whereas the vast majority of residual radioactivity within the detector are gammas which result in electronic recoils. Thus, knowing the separation of the ER from the NR band allows for a measure of the background rejection figure of merit for a liquid xenon experiment. We define the background rejection figure of merit as leakage fraction, reported here as the fraction of ER events that leak into the lower half of the NR band. Over 115,000 tritium decays were used for the ER band calibration, between 1-50 Phe in S1 (1-8 $\rm keV_{ee}$), and were found using standard WIMP search cuts within the fiducial volume. 
%A figure of merit for ER and NR discrimination is the leakage fraction defined as  the number of tritium events populating the lower half of the NR band are compared to the total number of tritium events in the selected energy range. 
%$\rm (1-erf((Mean\_ER-Mean\_NR)/(sqrt(2)*sigma\_ER)))/2 $.
Figure \ref{fig:Leak} shows the leakage fraction per 1 Phe bins of S1. The mean leakage fraction in the region used for the LUX 2013 PRL results, between 1-30 Phe (1-5 $\rm keV_{ee}$) in the fiducial, was found to be 0.42\% $\rm \pm$ 0.02\%, see Figure \ref{fig:Leak}.  
Figure \ref{fig:Spectrum} shows the reconstructed energy spectrum for those tritium events in the fiducial volume of the detector (black) along with the tritium spectrum from NEST modeling (blue) and an ideal tritium spectrum (magenta). The reconstructed energy matches the tritium beta spectrum well from 1 to 18 $\rm keV_{ee}$.
The calibration data was acquired in a 40 hour time window in which less than three out of 115,000 events are expected to be non tritium \cite{LUX_BG}, this implies a near perfect data purity for the calibration. Nearly every point (99.997\%) show in figure \ref{fig:Band} and the histogram of \ref{fig:Spectrum} is the result of a tritium beta decay in the fiducial volume of the LUX detector.

%The NR band used is from NEST version 0.98 and is vetted with AmBe, $\rm^{252}Cf$ and DD neutron generator calibrations.

\end{figure}


%Figure \ref{fig:NEST_v_Data} shows the comparison between simulation(NEST) and the data for the ER band. The agreement between simulation and data is good down to 7 Phe in S1. This is expected since at sub 2 $\rm keV{ee}$ (7 Phe in S1) data is limited and the NEST model has yet to be vetted at such low energies[Matthew/ Erik Dahl Thesis]. The newly acquired ER data below 2 $\rm keV{ee}$ from tritium will be used improve upon the NEST model at the extration field of 180 V/cm [ref?].

\subsection{Threshold Determination}

The tritiated methane calibration source provides beta decays with energies down to 0.1 $\rm keV_{ee}$ allowing for an independent measure the LUX detector's threshold. The limitation for detecting a single scatter WIMP like event event with PMTs is the S1 (primary scintillation) signal, being more than an order of magnitude less than the S2 signal. The S1 threshold could be measured by comparing the NEST model, assuming perfect detector resolution, to the observed tritium beta spectrum from 0.1-10 $\rm keV_{ee}$. The threshold determined by comparing the tritium data to NEST is in good agreement with all other methods used for determining the threshold in the LUX detector, figure \ref{fig:S1_Thresh}. 

%The threshold for the S2 (bottom PMT array) shown is entirely due to the S1 threshold. We use only the bottom PMT array for the S2 signal because the secondary scintillation light is more uniformly distributed along the bottom PMTs than the top PMTs. 
%Figure \ref{fig:E_spec} shows the tritium beta spectrum measured in the LUX detector along with the NEST prediction, note at the 180 V/cm drift field NEST has been vetted form 2 to 10 $\rm keV{ee}$.

 \subsection{Absolute Rate}
The absolute efficiency for detecting tritium events can be determined by comparing the number of observed events to the number expected. The initial activity injected was calculated to be $0.84 \pm 0.22 $ Bq, with the largest uncertainty coming from the ratio of $\rm CH_3T/CH_4$ from the tritiated methane source bottle. The purification time constant was measured to be 6.6 hours. From the initial rate and the purification constant we expect to count a total of $20,200 \pm 4,000 $ events in the LUX detector before applying the S1 threshold. With the S1 threshold we expect  $16,000 \pm 3,100 $ `golden' events. The actual count observed in the liquid xenon volume was 20,000 events, which is in good agreement with the expected value taking into account the uncertainty in the initial activity and the purification model. After making fiducial cut $7,700 \pm  1,500$ events were expected and a total of $9,500 \pm 100$ were observed.
%,  roughly $16,000 \pm  3,100 * (290/324)*(18^2/24.5^2)$. 



\section{Scintillation Yield and Ionization Yield from Tritium Beta Decay}


\subsection{Cuts used in this analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Standard LUX Pulse finder classifier used in the WIMP search.
\item $\rm S2_b > 100 [Phe] $
\item PDE (g1) = 0.138 $\rm \pm 0.005$, measured with Tritium
\item Extraction = 0.664 $\rm \pm 0.04$ measured with Tritium.
\item single e- = 9.95 $\rm \pm 0.1$ [Phe/e-]
\item Using NEST 4c bands.
\end{itemize}




Scintillation and ionization yield are measured using the tritiated methane calibration source from the S1, S2 and reconstructed energy of each beta decay. The energy of each decay is determined using a prescription described in [Erik Dahl], see equations \ref{eq:Gain} and \ref{eq:E_comb}. 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm  n_\gamma = \frac{S1}{g1}\\
\rm n_{e^{-}} = \frac{S2}{g2}
\label{eq:Gain}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rm E= \frac{1}{W}(n_\gamma + n_{e^-})\\
\rm E= \frac{1}{W}(\frac{S1}{g1} + \frac{S2}{g2})
\label{eq:E_comb}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The values of the work function W and gains g1, g2 have been measured using other calibration sources and are energy independent [ref]. Using equations \ref{eq:Gain} and \ref{eq:E_comb} we calculate the number of photons and electrons along with the energy of each tritium beta decay event to determine the yields. Scintillation and ionization yield are defined as [Photons/keV] and [Electrons/keV] respectively and the tritiated methane calibration source provides betas ranging from $\rm>1$ to 18 keV, with an exponential decline in event rate above 5 keV. For the results shown in figure \ref{fig:L_Q_Yield_180} over 150,000 beta decays in the fiducial volume were used to measure scintillation and ionization yield at 180 [V/cm]. A correction was applied for the beta spectral shape and the finite resolution of S1, S2 when measuring ionization and scintillation yield, the correction was found to be less than 10\% and is described in [my thesis]. Figure \ref{fig:L_Q_Yield_180} also shows the comparison of the results with the NEST model which has been vetted between 2 and 10 $\rm keV{ee}$. Also show are the measurements of light yield from a $\rm^{83m}Kr$ source, the 32.1 keV decay from $\rm^{83m}Kr$ is typically used as a standard calibration. (The second 9.4 keV decay from $\rm^{83m}Kr$  shown in the figure is for decays that occur more than 1000 ns after the initial 32.1 keV decay).

We find good agreement with the NEST model in the regions that have been vetted (2-10 $\rm keV{ee}$), see figure \ref{fig:L_Q_Yield_180}. Below 2 $\rm keV{ee}$ the light yield is lower than predicted by NEST and the charge yield is higher. The discrepancy between the data and the NEST model above 10 $\rm keV{ee}$ is due to limited data available for the model and also due to the track lengths of betas and gammas beginning to deviate above this energy. Note, under 10 $\rm keV{ee}$ track lengths of betas gammas are nearly identical. 

Figure \ref{fig:L_Q_Yield_Baudis} includes our light and charge yield measurements at 100 and 180 V/cm along with the recent Compton scattering measurement down to 1.5 $\rm keV{ee}$ from \cite{Baudis} at 450 V/cm. The error bars show in the figure include uncertainties from W, g1, g2 and the spectral shape correction. Unlike the measurement made using Compton scattering we can reconstruct energy using both the light and charge channels for each decay allowing for a powerful calibration down to 1 $\rm keV{ee}$ (corresponding to 80\% threshold at 2 Phe in S1).  We find a lower light yield than the centroids of the measurements in [ref Budias], however the the measurement is within reported errors. At our lower fields a higher light yield is expected than that measured at 450 V/cm due to less free charge separation.  The light yield of the 32.1 keV gamma from $\rm^{83m}Kr$ is shown on the figure as a measure of systematic uncertainty between the experiments. For the case of the standardized $\rm^{83m}Kr$ calibration source we find the expected behavior between the two experiments, a higher extraction field leads to lower light yield.

\section{Additional Calibrations with Tritium}

In this paper we have described the development and use of a tritiated methane calibration source for large scale xenon detectors. The primary application of the tritiated methane calibration source is to characterize the ER band and measure discrimination from electronic and nuclear recoils. However, much more fundamental xenon physics can be probed with the tritium calibration source. With higher statistics the discrimination can be measured in finer bins of energy or S1 Phe (figure \ref{fig:Leak}) along with the Gaussianity of the ER band. The log(S2/S1) has been assumed to have Gaussian behavior in past experiments, never before has there been an ER calibration with such high data purity in the WIMP search region to observe potential non-Gaussian behavior. The largest tritium calibration in LUX detector's fiducial region produced 115,000 tritium beta decays with only three being non tritium events. 
The tritium calibration can also used to calculate the light yield, charge yield and recombination fluctuation over the range from 1 to 18 $\rm KeV_{ee}$. The current data taken with the LUX detector has allowed for the vetting of the NEST model down to 1 $\rm keV_{ee}$ for the first time. Finally, tritium provides a low energy uniformly distributed source making it ideal for determining the fiducial volume of a detector and calibrating position reconstruction algorithms for low energy events.
