\section{Summary}

We have presented our new technique for injecting and removing CH$_3$T as an internal calibration source in detectors which utilize liquid and gas phase noble gases.  We discussed the assembly of our CH$_3$T calibration system, motivated by gas and liquid phase R\&D experiments at the University of Maryland.  We have used data from the LUX detector to show that our system can safely inject CH$_3$T for the purpose of internal calibration.
